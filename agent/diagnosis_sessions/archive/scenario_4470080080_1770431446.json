Extensive diagnostic workup for an IgM-producing clone (multiple bone marrow biopsies with IHC/flow/NGS including MYD88 L265P testing, peripheral blood cfDNA, PET‑CT, cryoglobulin and cold agglutinin testing) has been repeatedly non‑diagnostic/normal despite initial SPEP showing a monoclonal IgM spike, marked rouleaux, and elevated serum viscosity.",
    "Patient reports continued partial improvement in vision and decreased headache following plasmapheresis; no new systemic or ocular symptoms.",
    "Patient has a monoclonal IgM paraprotein with elevated serum viscosity and clinical hyperviscosity manifestations (bilateral retinal vein occlusions and headache) that improved after therapeutic plasmapheresis; multiple hematologic evaluations (bone marrow biopsies with immunophenotyping and molecular testing, peripheral flow cytometry, PET‑CT) have been repeatedly non‑diagnostic. Hematology has initiated rituximab‑based systemic therapy."

  "current_uncertainties": {
    "Waldenström macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma)": "fits IgM monoclonal spike and hyperviscosity but marrow/PET negative—could be low‑burden or sampling error",
    "IgM MGUS with symptomatic hyperviscosity": "monoclonal IgM without overt lymphoma but high IgM could still cause symptoms",
    "Other indolent B‑cell lymphoma (eg, splenic marginal zone lymphoma) with occult/low‑burden disease": "can produce IgM and evade detection on standard testing",
    "Cryoglobulinemic or cold‑agglutinin mediated microvascular disease": "could contribute to retinal findings but requires fresh/pre‑plasmapheresis testing to confirm."
