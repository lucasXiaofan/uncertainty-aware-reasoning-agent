Supporting evidence: Positive HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc indicate acute HBV infection; acute onset of fatigue and jaundice 2 days prior; very high ALT (~2,000 IU/L) typical of acute viral hepatitis; normal bilirubin and preserved PT/INR and albumin indicate preserved hepatic synthetic function (no fulminant failure at present). Other causes have been reasonably excluded: acetaminophen/toxin screens negative, HAV/HCV/HDV/HEV (not yet tested) and HSV/EBV/CMV negative, autoimmune serologies negative, abdominal ultrasound normal, and no hypotension to suggest ischemic hepatitis. The low/undetectable HBV DNA does not exclude acute infection because IgM anti-HBc reflects recent infection and viral load can be low during immune clearance; repeat quantitative HBV DNA has been obtained and remains low. Diagnostic confidence: high for acute HBV as the primary diagnosis. Management plan and remaining uncertainties: Continue close monitoring with serial hepatic panels and PT/INR (at least daily) and monitor for encephalopathy. No current criteria for urgent antiviral therapy (no coagulopathy or encephalopathy), but initiate antiviral therapy (eg, tenofovir) promptly if INR rises ≥1.5, bilirubin rises markedly, encephalopathy develops, or clinical deterioration occurs. Counsel regarding transmission, report to public health, test and vaccinate close contacts, and screen for HIV. Additional clarifying tests I would obtain if more rounds available: HEV IgM/HEV RNA (to exclude co-infection if travel/food exposures present), repeat HBV DNA with a highly sensitive assay, and HIV Ag/Ab testing.
