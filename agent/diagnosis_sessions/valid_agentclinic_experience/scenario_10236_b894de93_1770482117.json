      "action_reason": "Vital signs (temperature, HR, RR, BP, SpO2) and patient demographics are essential early information to differentiate infectious causes (pneumonia/aspiration) from PE or atelectasis — fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, or hypotension will change pretest probabilities and urgency."

      "action_reason": "A chest x-ray can identify air-space consolidation consistent with pneumonia, lobar collapse/atelectasis, or pleural effusion that suggests empyema — findings that will help distinguish pneumonia/effusion/atelectasis from pulmonary embolism (which often has a normal CXR).

      "action_reason": "CBC will assess for leukocytosis/neutrophilia supporting bacterial infection; blood cultures may identify bacteremia and guide antibiotics.

      "action_reason": "Surgery type/timing and any perioperative aspiration or intubation problems will help distinguish aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia and timing supports atelectasis vs infective pneumonia; this targeted history directly addresses the most likely and concerning differentials and will guide whether to obtain pleural imaging or start empiric antibiotics."

      "action_reason": "A chest ultrasound can detect a pleural effusion or loculated fluid consistent with empyema, which would support a diagnosis of pneumonia complication and help distinguish infection/effusion from atelectasis or PE; it is bedside, sensitive for effusion, and will guide further management (thoracentesis, drainage) if present."

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Procalcitonin",
      "action_reason": "Procalcitonin helps differentiate bacterial pneumonia (would be elevated) from nonbacterial causes such as atelectasis or inflammatory postoperative fever (would be low); this will guide need for empirical antibiotics while awaiting blood culture results."

      "action_reason": "A respiratory viral PCR will help differentiate viral from bacterial causes in the setting of normal procalcitonin and guide need for empiric antibiotics and infection control; it also helps explain acute cough onset and focal radiographic findings."

      "action_reason": "Antibiotic exposure could suppress sputum/blood culture results and lower procalcitonin, masking bacterial infection; history of chronic lung disease or smoking increases risk for bacterial pneumonia and affects pretest probability, helping differentiate bacterial pneumonia from atelectasis or noninfectious causes."

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Abdominal (surgical wound) exam",
      "action_reason": "A focused surgical wound exam will identify or exclude a surgical site infection as the source of fever.
