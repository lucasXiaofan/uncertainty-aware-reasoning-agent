Pediatric hematology and orthopedics consultations were unrevealing. 5) Alternate diagnoses (septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, PVNS, synovial tumor) are unlikely given lack of systemic signs, normal inflammatory markers, sterile synovial fluid, and normal MRI. Conclusion: most likely diagnosis is a self-limited traumatic hemarthrosis/acute synovial bleeding due to minor knee injury (occult soft-tissue/cartilage hemorrhage) without an underlying inherited bleeding disorder. Management plan and what would change the assessment: conservative treatment (analgesia appropriate for age, rest/immobilization as needed, ice, elevation if feasible), observe for resolution, close outpatient follow-up with pediatrics/orthopedics and hematology for recurrence. Immediate return precautions: fever, worsening pain, inability to bear weight, recurrent swelling or any bleeding from other sites. If recurrent hemarthroses occur, further evaluation would include repeat imaging (contrast MRI focused on vascular malformation or synovial lesion), repeat targeted joint aspiration during acute recurrence to document bloody fluid, and consideration of angiography/interventional radiology if a vascular lesion suspected.
