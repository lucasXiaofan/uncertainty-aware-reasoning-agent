Recommended immediate management: smoking cessation support, start inhaled bronchodilator therapy (long‑acting muscarinic antagonist ± long‑acting β2‑agonist), referral to pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination updates (influenza, pneumococcal), nutritional support and close follow‑up with repeat PFTs and weight monitoring. Given the extensive negative workup and the physiologic pattern, the most likely diagnosis is smoking‑related COPD (airway‑predominant with small‑airway disease and possible early emphysema).\n\n## Task:\nProvide a single, specific diagnosis (1-3 words). Examples:\n- \"Acute appendicitis\"\n- \"Community-acquired pneumonia\"\n- \"Type 2 diabetes mellitus\"\n- \"Atrial fibrillation\"\n\nDiagnosis:"
