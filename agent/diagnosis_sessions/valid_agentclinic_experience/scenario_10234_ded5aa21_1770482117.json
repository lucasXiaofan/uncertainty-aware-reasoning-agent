      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Vital Signs",
      "action_reason": "Obtain immediate assessment of cardiopulmonary stability (HR, BP, RR, Temp, SpO2) to determine urgency of resuscitation/transfer and to identify signs of shock or sepsis that would prioritize emergent surgical evaluation (e.g., volvulus). Vital signs are early critical data per clinical best practices."

      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Abdominal X-ray (supine and upright) and place nasogastric tube for decompression and aspirate",
      "action_reason": "Plain abdominal X-ray will identify obstruction pattern (air-fluid levels, proximal bowel gas, absence of distal gas, or pneumatosis/free air) and help triage need for urgent contrast study/surgery; nasogastric decompression is diagnostic (bilious aspirate) and therapeutic while awaiting imaging — this differentiates proximal surgical obstruction (e.g., malrotation/volvulus, atresia) from ileus/sepsis."

Were there any prenatal ultrasound findings (e.g., polyhydramnios or suspected GI obstruction)? Are there any dysmorphic features or a known chromosomal diagnosis (e.g., Down syndrome)?",
      "action_reason": "Gestational age, birth weight, history of meconium passage, prenatal polyhydramnios, and dysmorphic features help distinguish duodenal atresia (commonly with polyhydramnios and trisomy 21) from malrotation/volvulus or annular pancreas and will guide urgency of contrast imaging and surgical consultation."

      "action_reason": "An upper GI series will differentiate malrotation/volvulus (abnormal position of the ligament of Treitz or corkscrew appearance) from intrinsic proximal duodenal obstruction (atresia, annular pancreas, or web). Malrotation with volvulus is a surgical emergency and must be identified/excluded promptly to guide urgent management."

        "Duodenal atresia": "double-bubble on AXR and association with Down syndrome make this most likely",
        "Annular pancreas": "can produce duodenal obstruction with similar radiograph and may have a normal upper GI if partial obstruction",

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Abdominal ultrasound",
      "action_reason": "Abdominal ultrasound can help evaluate for annular pancreas, assess pancreatic anatomy, look for proximal duodenal dilatation vs obstruction, and screen for other intra-abdominal anomalies; this helps differentiate annular pancreas from intrinsic duodenal atresia or more distal obstruction and will guide need for surgical planning."

        "Malrotation with Ladd bands (or midgut volvulus)": "can present with bilious vomiting and proximal obstruction but upper GI series was reported normal, making this less likely but not fully excluded."

      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Contrast enema (lower GI series)",
      "action_reason": "A contrast enema will assess the caliber of the colon (microcolon suggests a proximal obstructive lesion such as duodenal/jejunal atresia) and can help exclude distal obstructive causes (e.g., meconium ileus or distal atresia). This will help differentiate proximal duodenal obstruction (duodenal atresia/annular pancreas) from more distal obstructions and guide surgical planning."

      "action_reason": "Labs will identify and correct electrolyte and metabolic derangements prior to operative management; blood type/crossmatch prepares for possible transfusion. Pediatric surgery consultation is needed because imaging and exam strongly suggest proximal intestinal obstruction (likely duodenal atresia) that typically requires surgical repair; echocardiogram is indicated given high prevalence of congenital heart disease in infants with Down syndrome and influences perioperative planning."

      "action": "DIAGNOSIS READY",
      "action_reason": "Summary of case and rationale for confident diagnosis: Term neonate (3050 g) with feeding intolerance, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass meconium. Plain abdominal radiograph shows classic “double bubble” sign. Upper GI series and contrast enema are non-diagnostic for malrotation or distal obstruction; abdominal ultrasound normal. Dysmorphic features strongly suggest trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), which has a well-known association with congenital duodenal obstruction. Basic labs and pre-op echocardiogram are normal and pediatric surgery has been consulted. Differential diagnoses were: 1) Duodenal atresia/obstruction: most likely—double-bubble, bilious vomiting, association with Down features; 2) Annular pancreas: possible—can produce identical imaging and symptoms; 3) Duodenal web with perforation or fenestration: less likely but possible. Why final diagnosis now: the combination of imaging (double bubble), clinical presentation (bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium), and phenotypic features of Down syndrome makes congenital duodenal obstruction (most likely duodenal atresia) the leading diagnosis with high confidence. How remaining uncertainties would be resolved if more time: operative exploration (or intraoperative contrast/duodenoscopy) will definitively distinguish atresia from annular pancreas or web. What I recommend next (clinical plan): continue NG decompression and IV fluid/electrolyte support, obtain genetic testing (karyotype or rapid microarray) to confirm trisomy 21, proceed to surgical correction (typically duodenoduodenostomy) as recommended by pediatric surgery, and ensure NICU perioperative care and antibiotic prophylaxis. If available, discuss with surgery whether any additional preoperative imaging is needed, but operative management is both diagnostic and therapeutic. If more rounds available, I would document the karyotype result and any intraoperative findings to definitively confirm the etiology of the obstruction.",
