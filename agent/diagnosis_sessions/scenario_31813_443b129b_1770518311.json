loss—depends on exposure history, HIV-associated opportunistic infection (e.g., MAC, PCP): patient never tested for HIV and has systemic symptoms—immunosuppression could explain negative AFB and atypical infections.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Chest X-ray (PA and lateral)\n\n[Step 6]\nNew Info: Chest X-ray (PA and lateral) shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates.\nDifferential: Pulmonary tuberculosis (including smear/NAAT-negative or miliary TB): risk factors include prison exposure, chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats despite negative initial sputum tests, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): subacute dry cough, weight loss, fever, diffuse interstitial infiltrates and unknown HIV status could indicate immunosuppression, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis): systemic symptoms, weight loss, diffuse infiltrates possible in immunocompromised patients, Lymphoma with pulmonary involvement: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) and diffuse infiltrates could represent malignancy-related pulmonary disease.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: HIV antigen/antibody (4th generation) test\n\n[Step 7]\nNew Info: HIV 4th-generation antigen/antibody test returned negative (normal readings).\nDifferential: Pulmonary tuberculosis: Classic symptoms (chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, fevers) and incarceration exposure make TB likely, but sputum AFB/NAAT were negative, Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (e.g., MAC): can cause chronic cough and diffuse infiltrates and may yield negative routine tests or require bronchoscopy for diagnosis, Fungal pulmonary infection (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis): can present subacutely with systemic symptoms and diffuse infiltrates depending on exposure/endemic area, Pulmonary malignancy with diffuse metastatic or miliary pattern: weight loss and chronic cough raise concern for cancer despite infectious features.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Chest CT (high-resolution)\n\n[Step 8]\nNew Info: High-resolution chest CT reported as normal (no focal consolidation, cavitation, or lymphadenopathy identified).\nDifferential: Pulmonary tuberculosis: High pretest probability from chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss and incarceration exposure but negative sputum AFB/NAAT and normal HRCT reduce but do not exclude paucibacillary or miliary/early disease, Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (e.g., MAC): Can cause chronic systemic symptoms and cough, may have negative MTB-specific NAAT and variable imaging, Chronic fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis): Can present with systemic B symptoms and diffuse infiltrates on CXR but HRCT sensitivity varies, Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) fit and CXR may be misleading—pulmonary involvement or mediastinal nodes might be occult on HRCT.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (send BAL for AFB smear/culture, mycobacterial NAAT, fungal stain/culture, bacterial culture, and cytology) and transbronchial biopsy\n\n[Step 9]\nNew Info: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy returned normal (no pathogens identified, cytology and histology non-diagnostic).\nDifferential: Smear-negative or paucibacillary pulmonary (or miliary) tuberculosis: compatible systemic symptoms (weight loss, fevers, night sweats) and prison exposure but multiple negative respiratory and BAL tests could reflect low bacillary load, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis): chronic constitutional symptoms and diffuse infiltrates possible, BAL/biopsy can miss organisms without targeted fungal testing, Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) and normal bronchoscopic samples—nodal or marrow disease could explain systemic findings, Sarcoidosis or other inflammatory interstitial disease: can cause chronic cough and systemic symptoms though CT was unremarkable, still possible.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Full physical examination focusing on cervical/axillary/inguinal lymphadenopathy and abdominal exam for hepatosplenomegaly\n\n[Step 10]\nNew Info: Physical exam: generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary, inguinal) and hepatomegaly; no splenomegaly.\nDifferential: Disseminated tuberculosis: chronic cough, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, prison exposure and diffuse infiltrates support TB despite negative sputum/BAL NAAT and smears (paucibacillary or extrapulmonary TB possible), Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly strongly suggest malignancy, Disseminated fungal infection (eg, histoplasmosis): constitutional symptoms, generalized LAD and hepatomegaly can occur and may produce negative pulmonary AFB testing.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Excisional lymph node biopsy for histopathology, flow cytometry, AFB stain/culture, mycobacterial NAAT, and fungal stain/culture\n\n[Step 11]\nNew Info: Excisional lymph node biopsy returned normal: histopathology without malignancy or granulomas, flow cytometry normal, AFB stain/culture negative, mycobacterial NAAT negative, fungal stains/cultures negative.\nDifferential: Lymphoma: generalized lymphadenopathy and B symptoms strongly suggest lymphoma, but a normal excisional biopsy reduces likelihood though sampling error or early/occult lymphoma remains possible, Tuberculosis (including miliary or extrapulmonary TB): incarceration exposure, chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss suggest TB, but repeated negative AFB smears, NAATs, BAL, and lymph node studies lower probability though false negatives possible, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., Histoplasma): explains systemic symptoms, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, but fungal tests thus far negative and exposure unclear, Sarcoidosis: can cause diffuse pulmonary findings and lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms, biopsy without granulomas argues against but sampling error or non-caseating granulomas missed remains possible.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, CMP, LFTs, LDH, and blood cultures\n\n[Step 12]\nNew Info: CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, CMP, LFTs, LDH, and blood cultures are all within normal limits.\nDifferential: Disseminated tuberculosis: highly suspected given prison exposure, chronic cough, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, diffuse infiltrates and hepatomegaly, but multiple negative AFB smears/NAATs/cultures reduce likelihood though false negatives possible, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., Histoplasma): fits systemic symptoms, hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates, TB tests negative and fungal testing not yet done, Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly fit, but prior excisional lymph node biopsy and flow cytometry were reportedly normal—possible sampling/interpretation error or early marrow-predominant disease, Sarcoidosis: can cause pulmonary infiltrates and lymphadenopathy with hepatomegaly, but systemic infective features (fever, night sweats) and normal lymph node biopsy make this less likely.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Urine Histoplasma antigen and serum fungal serologies (Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces)\n\n[Step 13]\nNew Info: Urine Histoplasma antigen and serum fungal serologies returned normal/negative.\nDifferential: Disseminated tuberculosis: high clinical suspicion due to chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss, prison exposure, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly despite multiple negative sputum/BAL/lymph node tests (possible pauci-bacillary or sampling error), Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly fit lymphoma though excisional node biopsy reported normal (possible missed focus or sampling/interpretation error), Sarcoidosis: can cause diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and constitutional symptoms though night sweats and fevers less classic, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., Histoplasmosis): fits systemic picture but urine antigen and serologies are negative, lowering probability though false negatives occur.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Bone marrow biopsy with histopathology, AFB stain/culture, mycobacterial NAAT, fungal stain/culture, and flow cytometry\n\n[Step 14]\nNew Info: Bone marrow biopsy with histopathology, AFB stain/culture, mycobacterial NAAT, fungal stain/culture, and flow cytometry returned normal.\nDifferential: Sarcoidosis: Explains dry cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, negative infectious stains and cultures, ACE/calcium may help, Lymphoma (occult/sampling error): B symptoms and lymphadenopathy fit but multiple biopsies/flow cytometry have been nondiagnostic—possible missed site, Disseminated mycobacterial infection (including NTM/TB paucibacillary): Constitutional symptoms and exposure history fit despite repeatedly negative microbiology, Multicentric Castleman disease/HHV-8-associated or other lymphoproliferative disorders: Presents with systemic symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy and can have nondiagnostic routine labs.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: FDG-PET/CT to localize hypermetabolic lymph nodes or extranodal sites to target for repeat biopsy and assess for occult malignancy or inflammatory disease.\n\n[Step 15]\nNew Info: FDG-PET/CT: normal — no hypermetabolic lymph nodes or extranodal uptake identified.\nDifferential: Occult lymphoma (Hodgkin or T-cell lymphoma): B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly fit but prior node biopsy/flow cytometry and PET/CT were negative which could reflect sampling error or low-volume disease, Disseminated tuberculosis (paucibacillary): chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss, prison exposure support TB despite repeatedly negative AFB/NAAT/cultures, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis): systemic symptoms and hepatomegaly consistent but fungal serologies/antigen and cultures were negative possibly false-negative, Sarcoidosis or other granulomatous/inflammatory disease: systemic lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms possible though biopsies/imaging have not shown characteristic findings.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Repeat excisional biopsy of the largest accessible lymph node with extended histopathology including immunohistochemistry for CD15, CD30, CD20, PAX5, and CD3; EBER in-situ hybridization; stain for acid-fast bacilli and fungi; broad-range PCR for mycobacteria and fungi; and hematopathology/oncology review for possible repeat sampling requirements.\n\n[Step 16]\nNew Info: Repeat excisional lymph node biopsy with extended histopathology (IHC for CD15, CD30, CD20, PAX5, CD3; EBER ISH; stains for AFB/fungi; broad-range PCR) returned normal/readings.\nDifferential: 1) Lymphoma (including Hodgkin and peripheral T-cell lymphoma): classic B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly despite nondiagnostic biopsies—possible patchy/cryptic disease or sampling error, 2) Disseminated mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or NTM): compatible systemic symptoms and prison exposure but multiple smears/NAAT/cultures negative—could be paucibacillary or extrapulmonary with intermittent shedding, 3) Multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8–associated or idiopathic): systemic inflammatory symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly with potentially non-specific histology, 4) Sarcoidosis or other granulomatous/inflammatory disorder: can produce diffuse infiltrates, lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms but biopsies have not shown granulomas.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement studies on the most recently excised lymph node tissue\n\n[Step 17]\nNew Info: T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement studies on the most recently excised lymph node tissue returned normal (no clonal rearrangement detected).\nDifferential: Occult lymphoma (sampling error/low tumor burden): persistent B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly strongly suggest lymphoma despite multiple negative biopsies and clonality studies, Multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated or idiopathic): constitutional symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly fit MCD, which can be missed on routine histology and requires IL-6 and HHV-8 testing, Atypical/chronic infection (e.g., Tropheryma whipplei, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, intracellular pathogens): prolonged fever, weight loss, cough and incarceration exposure could indicate unusual pathogens that may evade standard cultures/NAATs and need targeted PCR/stains, Granulomatous/inflammatory disease (e.g., sarcoidosis or adult-onset Still disease): systemic inflammation with lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly possible, but biopsies and imaging have not shown classic findings—disease can be patchy.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Serum IL-6 level and plasma HHV-8 PCR, and Tropheryma whipplei PCR on available lymph node tissue and stool\n\n[Step 18]\nNew Info: Serum IL-6 level, plasma HHV-8 PCR, and Tropheryma whipplei PCR results returned normal.\nDifferential: Occult lymphoma: generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, B symptoms fit lymphoma but extensive biopsies/IHC/flow cytometry and PET were nondiagnostic—sampling error or low-grade/cryptic lymphoma possible, Disseminated mycobacterial infection (M. tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria): incarceration, chronic cough, night sweats, weight loss suggest TB, but multiple AFB smears/NAAT/cultures and biopsies negative—paucibacillary disease or false negatives remain possible, Chronic systemic fungal infection (e.g., Histoplasma, Coccidioides): compatible systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy/hepatomegaly though fungal serologies/antigen tests and cultures were negative—possible false-negatives or low-burden disease, Granulomatous/inflammatory disease (sarcoidosis or IgG4-related disease): can cause diffuse LAD, hepatomegaly, systemic symptoms and normal infectious workup, but multiple biopsies lacked diagnostic histology—still possible if lesions were missed or sampling inadequate.\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Have you had exposures to birds or bats, cave/spelunking, farming or soil disturbance, travel to areas endemic for histoplasma/coccidioides, consumption of unpasteurized dairy, recent tattoos, IV drug use, or current/prior immunosuppressive medication use?\n\n[Step 19]\nNew Info: Patient reports no exposures to birds, bats, caves, farming/soil work, travel to endemic areas, consumption of unpasteurized dairy, no recent tattoos, no IV drug use, and no immunosuppressive medication use; only notable exposure history is recent incarceration.\nDifferential: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL): systemic B symptoms, hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and negative nodal biopsies/imaging can occur with IVL which is often detected on random deep skin biopsies, Disseminated tuberculosis: classic constitutional symptoms and incarceration exposure increase risk, but multiple sputum/BAL/biopsy/NAAT tests are repeatedly negative making active TB less likely but possible due to sampling limitations, Nodal lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin): persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and B symptoms fit, but multiple excisional biopsies and flow cytometry were nondiagnostic—sampling error or unusual histology remains possible, Disseminated fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis): can cause fever, weight loss, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, but fungal serologies/antigen tests and cultures have been negative reducing likelihood.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Random deep skin punch biopsies (3 separate sites) including subcutaneous fat for histopathology and immunohistochemistry to evaluate for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (intravascular lymphoma).",
