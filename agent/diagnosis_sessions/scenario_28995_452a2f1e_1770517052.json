My remaining leading differentials are: 1) Occult/patchy lymphoma (including T‑cell or other histologies that can be focal and difficult to capture) — supported by generalized lymphadenopathy, B symptoms, hepatomegaly; 2) Occult, low-burden or treated/contained disseminated infection (e.g., paucibacillary TB or very fastidious intracellular organisms) — supported by incarceration exposure, chronic cough, fevers; 3) Rare immune-mediated/inflammatory disease (e.g., atypical sarcoidosis or autoinflammatory syndromes) or other uncommon hematologic disorders. None of these could be confirmed or excluded with available tests.\n\nBecause we have used nearly all available diagnostic rounds and exhaustive testing without a diagnosis, I am declaring a working conclusion of undiagnosed chronic systemic illness with the above prioritized differential. Recommended next actions (what I would still clarify with further rounds or referral):\n- Obtain a fresh, large excisional lymph node from a clinically active site (if present) and send to a tertiary academic center for repeat expert hematopathology review, NGS-based clonality (deep IGH/TR sequencing), and paired tumor/normal genomic profiling; consider repeat PET-CT to localize active node if one can be targeted.\n- Repeat comprehensive laboratory panel if not already obtained: CBC with diff, peripheral smear review, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, ferritin, triglycerides, fibrinogen, soluble IL-2 receptor (sCD25) to evaluate for HLH-like process.\n- Consider targeted empiric therapy only after multidisciplinary discussion: either empiric anti-TB therapy if clinical suspicion increases despite negative testing, or a carefully monitored corticosteroid trial if inflammatory disease is suspected — both carry risks and should be pursued in consultation with ID and hematology/oncology.\n- Ensure symptomatic care: treat fevers, address nutrition, evaluate for prophylaxis needs.\n- Refer to a tertiary center (infectious diseases + hematology/oncology + pathology) for coordinated re-evaluation and possible repeat tissue acquisition.\n\nRationale: Further rounds are unlikely to change the diagnostic picture without repeat targeted tissue sampling and expert review. The remaining key uncertainties (occult lymphoma vs occult infection vs inflammatory disorder) are best resolved by obtaining fresh tissue for more sensitive molecular testing and by re-assessing labs for HLH/immune activation. If transfer to a specialized center is not feasible, consider highest-yield alternatives: repeat excisional biopsy from a new site or repeat PET-CT to find a metabolically active target.\n\nI would clarify the above items with one or two additional diagnostic actions (repeat PET/CT and a targeted excisional biopsy sent to an expert hematopathology reference lab).",
