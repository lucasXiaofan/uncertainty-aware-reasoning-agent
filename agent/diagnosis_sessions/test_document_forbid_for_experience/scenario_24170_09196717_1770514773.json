      "action_reason": "Vital signs (temperature, BP, HR, RR, SpO2) and basic demographics (age, sex, smoking status) will identify fever (supports infection/TB), hypoxia (severity and need for urgent oxygen/ imaging), and risk factors (age/smoking) to narrow the differential and guide next focused questions and tests."

Chest X-ray often guides need for CT or sputum studies.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Chest X-ray (PA and lateral)",
      "action_reason": "A chest radiograph will quickly identify patterns (upper‑lobe cavitation suggesting TB, focal mass suggesting malignancy, diffuse/bronchiectatic changes suggesting chronic infection) and guide next steps (sputum AFB, CT chest, bronchoscopy).

A positive test would prioritize bronchoscopy/BAL for PCP and fungal stains; a negative test would shift focus toward non‑HIV causes (e.g., malignancy, non‑tuberculous infections) and prompt CT chest and tissue diagnosis."

      "action_reason": "Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy allows direct airway visualization (identify endobronchial lesions), obtains lower respiratory samples for cultures and molecular testing for TB/fungi, and provides tissue for histopathology to diagnose malignancy, sarcoidosis, organizing pneumonia, or other inflammatory processes—highly useful when chest X‑ray and CT are discordant and sputum tests are non-diagnostic."

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: PET-CT (whole-body)",
      "action_reason": "A whole-body PET-CT will detect metabolically active malignancy or granulomatous/inflammatory foci not evident on noncontrast HRCT or bronchoscopy, helping to distinguish occult cancer from chronic infection or inflammatory disease. A positive focal hypermetabolic lesion would direct targeted biopsy; a diffusely increased uptake could support inflammatory/infectious etiologies.

Have you ever been treated for tuberculosis or received BCG vaccination? Any known household or close contacts with active TB? Any focal bone/back pain or persistent lymph node swelling?",
      "action_reason": "Prior TB testing, prior treatment, or BCG history will change pretest probability and interpretation of negative sputum/BAL studies; known TB contacts or localizing symptoms (lymphadenopathy, bone pain) would prompt targeted extrapulmonary evaluation (e.g., lymph node biopsy, spine imaging) or empiric treatment versus continued diagnostic observation."

      "reference_relevance": "Past guideline experiences were partially helpful: they emphasize focused history and bedside exam to uncover exposures and localizing features, but many prior advanced diagnostic tests here were nondiagnostic, so guideline suggestions (physical exam, exposure/ travel history) remain relevant yet insufficient alone to resolve uncertainties.",

Also, are your fevers/night sweats daily or intermittent and how many nights per week do they wake you?",
      "action_reason": "Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, malabsorption, arthralgias) and neurologic signs would point toward systemic infections like Whipple disease or Bartonella and help distinguish them from pulmonary‑limited TB or occult lymphoma; pattern/severity of night sweats and detectable peripheral lymphadenopathy can support lymphoma or chronic infection and guide targeted repeat biopsies or serologies."

Prior cases emphasize the value of direct observation, supervised specimen collection, and psychiatric evaluation when exhaustive testing is unrevealing; they also support targeted bedside reassessment (eg, repeat observed vitals/exam) to confirm objective findings. However, most guideline experiences focused on stepwise infectious/malignancy workups rather than managing suspected factitious presentations, so applicability is partial.",

      "action_reason": "Observed inpatient monitoring with supervised specimen collection will confirm whether the fevers and other objective signs are reproducible and genuine (supporting occult infection/malignancy) versus inconsistent or induced (supporting factitious disorder). A psychiatry consult helps assess for factitious disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or malingering and addresses psychosocial contributors. Asking about non-prescription/illicit substances may reveal exogenous causes of symptoms or fever-mimicking agents and helps avoid unnecessary further invasive testing."

Objective clinic temperature recorded 38.1°C. Chest x‑ray shows diffuse infiltrates but HRCT and PET‑CT normal. Extensive microbiologic, serologic, molecular, and histopathologic evaluation is uniformly negative: repeated sputum AFB/NAAT/cultures (including liquid MGIT), BAL with cultures and PCR, transbronchial and VATS wedge lung biopsies with special stains and cultures, blood/urine mycobacterial testing, bone marrow biopsy with AFB/fungal stains and cultures, broad-range 16S/ITS sequencing, fungal serologies/antigens (Histoplasma urine, cryptococcal antigen, Coccidioides), Coxiella/Nocardia testing, HIV, Quantiferon, ANCA, quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, lymphocyte subsets, CBC, ESR/CRP, LDH — all normal. Patient has incarceration history (raises TB pretest probability), but multiple negative tests across tissue, fluid, and blood make occult TB or occult disseminated infection exceedingly unlikely. PET‑CT and multiple biopsies make occult malignancy (including lymphoma) unlikely.\n\nDiagnostic synthesis and conclusion: Given the exhaustive negative objective workup despite persistent subjective symptoms, the most likely explanation is a disorder in the spectrum of factitious disorder (fever fabrication / induced or simulated fever) or, less likely, psychogenic (stress‑related) fever. This fits because: (1) objective inflammatory and microbiologic testing are repeatedly normal, (2) advanced imaging and tissue sampling show no pathologic process, and (3) the only documented fever is low‑grade and not yet confirmed under continuous observed inpatient monitoring.\n\nHow uncertainties were resolved: Infectious causes (including TB and atypical mycobacteria) and malignancy were actively and repeatedly searched for using appropriate specimens, imaging (including PET‑CT), and invasive tissue sampling; their absence across these modalities substantially lowers their likelihood. Autoimmune and immunodeficiency causes were also tested and not supported. That leaves non‑organic causes (factitious/psychogenic) as the most parsimonious explanation.\n\nRemaining clarifications that would ideally be obtained (and recommended next steps):\n- Inpatient observed evaluation with continuous temperature monitoring, supervised specimen collection, and direct observation of febrile episodes to confirm whether objective fevers recur under observation (patient has consented). Confirmation of lack of objective fever during observation would support factitious disorder; confirmation of recurrent objective fever with correlating inflammatory response would require re‑evaluation and repeat targeted testing.\n- Psychiatric assessment (consult liaison psychiatry) to evaluate for factitious disorder, somatic symptom disorder, depression, or other psychiatric contributors, and to plan supportive management.\n- Social work involvement and careful, nonjudgmental discussion with the patient; maintain therapeutic alliance while avoiding confrontation or premature accusation.\n- If inpatient monitoring documents true fever with new objective inflammatory changes, repeat targeted microbiologic and molecular testing (observed, time‑stamped samples) and consider empiric therapy guided by new findings.\n\nFinal documented diagnosis (provisional): Chronic unexplained low‑grade fever and constitutional symptoms most consistent with factitious disorder (fever fabrication) vs psychogenic fever. Provisional diagnosis pending confirmation by inpatient observed monitoring (continuous temperatures and supervised specimen collection) and psychiatric evaluation.\n\nImmediate management recommendations: Arrange inpatient observed monitoring as agreed, initiate supportive care (nutrition, symptomatic treatment for night sweats and insomnia), consult psychiatry and social work, avoid unnecessary empiric prolonged antimicrobial therapy unless new objective data emerge, and approach the patient nonjudgmentally to preserve trust and facilitate psychiatric care and recovery.",
