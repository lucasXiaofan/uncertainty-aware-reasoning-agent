When was the last bowel movement and what was its consistency (hard/pebble-like, soft, or liquid)? Has the baby had similar episodes before or a history of chronic constipation? Is there fever, increased irritability or painful crying, and has feeding/weight changed recently?",

Therefore ultrasound result is useful but additional imaging/physical exam is warranted.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Abdominal X-ray (supine and upright)",
      "action_reason": "An abdominal X-ray will assess bowel gas pattern, detect dilated loops and air-fluid levels suggestive of small-bowel obstruction or signs of perforation, and help differentiate obstructive surgical causes from non-surgical etiologies; this will narrow the differential and guide need for urgent surgical/contrast studies."

Other experiences suggested evaluating for intussusception, but ultrasound was already normal, making contrast studies (air contrast enema) less favored as first step for volvulus. Overall the guidance was helpful and applicable.",

      "action_reason": "A focused inguinal/scrotal exam can identify a tender, irreducible inguinal mass (or scrotal swelling) consistent with an incarcerated hernia — a common, high-yield, and easily reversible cause of obstruction in this age group. Finding an incarcerated hernia would confirm the diagnosis and direct urgent surgical management; a normal exam would make distal intrinsic obstruction or internal hernia more likely and prompt next step testing (contrast enema to evaluate distal colon or abdominal CT/operative exploration)."

      "action_reason": "A rectal suction biopsy is the gold‑standard diagnostic test to detect absence of ganglion cells and hypertrophic nerve trunks, which will confirm Hirschsprung disease and distinguish it from structural strictures or functional disorders; results will directly guide definitive surgical management (pull‑through) or prompt alternative diagnoses if ganglion cells are present."

Anorectal manometry can be adjunctive but is less reliable in infants and does not replace histologic confirmation.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Full-thickness rectal biopsy (surgical) with calretinin immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry",
      "action_reason": "A full-thickness rectal biopsy obtains submucosa and myenteric plexus tissue, reducing the risk of false-negative results from superficial suction biopsy and allowing definitive evaluation for aganglionosis. Calretinin and AChE staining improve diagnostic accuracy (loss of calretinin and increased AChE support Hirschsprung disease). This will confirm or exclude Hirschsprung disease and distinguish it from functional/neuropathic causes of obstruction."

      "action_reason": "Endoscopic visualization can identify focal mechanical causes (web, stricture, stenosis, extrinsic compression) that would produce a transition zone on contrast enema despite normal ganglion cells. It also allows targeted deeper biopsies and tissue sampling for specialized histologic assessment (to detect hypoganglionosis/intestinal neuronal dysplasia) that routine calretinin/AChE stains may miss. This test best differentiates between mechanical obstruction versus ganglion cell/neuronal disorders and can be diagnostic and potentially therapeutic."

      "action_reason": "Anorectal manometry will determine presence or absence of the RAIR — absent RAIR strongly supports Hirschsprung disease despite prior negative biopsies and would justify re‑sampling or surgical referral; presence of a normal RAIR makes Hirschsprung unlikely and supports motility disorder or anatomic intermittent obstruction, guiding further tests (full GI motility evaluation or targeted imaging/surgical review)."

      "action_reason": "Antroduodenal and colonic manometry will differentiate primary motility disorders (CIPO), which show abnormal propagation/low‑amplitude or absent peristalsis, from mechanical obstruction or Hirschsprung disease. Given preserved RAIR and normal biopsies, manometry is the next specific test to confirm a neuropathic or myopathic motility disorder and to guide medical vs surgical management.

        "1) Cow's‑milk protein‑induced enteropathy/colitis (non‑IgE CMPA)": "most likely — explains distension, pain with palpation, normal structural/neuromuscular testing, and potential response to maternal elimination. 2) Chronic intestinal pseudo‑obstruction/enteric dysmotility: less likely given normal antroduodenal/colonic manometry, normal genetics, and normal transit study, but persistent dysmotility could still be intermittent/early. 3) Intermittent mechanical obstruction (partial obstructing web/stricture/intussusception): unlikely after normal exploratory laparotomy, imaging, and endoscopy but may be transient or radiographically occult."
      },
      "reference_relevance": "Helpful — Prior guideline experiences support a diagnostic therapeutic trial of maternal cow’s‑milk protein elimination in exclusively breastfed infants with suspected CMPA when structural causes have been excluded; surgical/motility guideline references were useful to prioritize noninvasive trial after exhaustive negative testing. Some guideline entries emphasized cardiac and congenital anomaly assessment in neonates, which is less relevant here. Overall, guidelines support the chosen next-step (elimination trial) as an evidence‑based, low‑risk diagnostic maneuver.",
      "action": "ASK PATIENT: Please confirm you will continue strict maternal avoidance of all cow’s‑milk protein for 2 weeks, maintain a daily diary recording (a) abdominal distension (measure/photograph if possible), (b) painful crying episodes with abdominal palpation, (c) feeding amount/tolerance, and (d) stool frequency/consistency. Return for clinical reassessment at 2 weeks. If symptoms improve, we will plan supervised maternal reintroduction or direct infant oral challenge to confirm diagnosis; if no improvement after 2–4 weeks, we will proceed with referral to pediatric gastroenterology for advanced motility evaluation and pain management.",
      "action_reason": "A monitored 2‑week maternal dairy elimination is a low‑risk, high‑yield diagnostic therapeutic trial that can confirm or exclude cow’s‑milk protein‑induced enteropathy as the cause of the infant’s feeding difficulty, abdominal distension, and pain. Improvement during elimination would strongly favor non‑IgE CMPA and avoid further invasive testing; lack of improvement would push investigation toward motility disorders or other rarer causes and justify gastroenterology referral."

      "reference_relevance": "Helpful — prior guideline/experience supports a diagnostic therapeutic maternal elimination trial for suspected non‑IgE CMPA when extensive structural and motility testing is unrevealing. This approach is low risk and can be diagnostic if symptoms improve; if unhelpful, it directs next steps (motility referral).",
      "action": "ASK PATIENT: Please return for clinical reassessment at 2 weeks after strict maternal dairy elimination. Call immediately and present to ED sooner if any of the following occur: bilious (green) vomiting, persistent fever, rapidly increasing abdominal distension or respiratory difficulty, lethargy/decreased responsiveness, refusal of feeds or inability to maintain hydration, new or worsening bloody stools, or no bowel movement for >48 hours. Continue the daily diary with photos and contact the clinic earlier if you notice clear improvement so we can plan supervised maternal reintroduction or infant challenge to confirm diagnosis.",
      "action_reason": "A supervised 2‑week maternal dairy elimination is a low‑risk, high‑yield diagnostic trial for non‑IgE CMPA; symptomatic improvement within days to 2 weeks would confirm probable non‑IgE CMPA and avoid further invasive testing. If there is no improvement, persistent or worsening symptoms despite elimination would increase likelihood of a functional or motility disorder and prompt referral to pediatric gastroenterology for advanced evaluation and pain management."

      "reference_relevance": "Prior guideline experiences for similar pediatric obstructive presentations partially helpful: contrast studies and imaging are sensitive but can be misleading (false-positive transition zones) when inflammation or functional spasm present; exhaustive biopsies and manometry are definitive for excluding Hirschsprung and primary neuropathic CIPO when normal.

      "action": "FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Provisional diagnosis—non‑IgE mediated cow’s‑milk protein‑induced enteropathy/proctocolitis (breastmilk‑mediated) causing distal colonic functional obstruction/colonic dysmotility (Hirschsprung mimic). Confirm with clinical response to strict maternal cow’s‑milk protein elimination and supervised re‑challenge. If no improvement after 2–4 weeks, escalate to pediatric gastroenterology for further motility/pain evaluation and consider alternate diagnoses (occult enteric neuropathy, intermittent mechanical obstruction, or atypical CIPO).",
      "action_reason": "All structural (imaging, endoscopy, laparotomy), histologic (rectal and serial mapping biopsies with specialized stains), motility (anorectal and antroduodenal/colonic manometry), and genetic testing were repeatedly normal, effectively excluding Hirschsprung disease, mechanical distal obstruction, and primary congenital enteric neuropathy. The contrast enema transition zone likely represents a functional/secondary transition from colonic hypomotility or inflammation rather than aganglionosis. The clinical context (breastfed infant, abdominal distension and painful episodes but normal stools and systemic signs) and lack of alternative explanations make non‑IgE cow’s‑milk protein–mediated enteropathy the most likely diagnosis pending therapeutic confirmation by maternal dairy elimination."
