Comprehensive infectious, autoimmune, metabolic, toxin, and imaging workup was negative. The patient stopped glyburide and sitagliptin and experienced rapid clinical and biochemical recovery: AST/ALT and bilirubin normalized within 48–72 hours, PT/INR and albumin remained normal, and symptoms resolved. This temporal relationship with dechallenge strongly supports acute drug‑induced liver injury (DILI) from one or both diabetes medications as the primary cause. \n\nHBV serology is discordant: persistently positive HBsAg and HBeAg on multiple confirmatory assays with positive anti‑HBc total (IgG) but repeatedly undetectable HBV DNA by high‑sensitivity PCR (including reference lab), undetectable serum HBV RNA, negative liver tissue HBV PCR, and absence of anti‑HBc IgM. This pattern makes active replicative hepatitis B infection unlikely. The most likely explanations are: 1) assay interference or rare persistent false‑positive HBsAg/HBeAg despite confirmatory testing, or 2) prior resolved or occult infection with persistent nonreplicative surface/envelope antigen detection—both are not consistent with active viral replication. Given repeatedly undetectable HBV nucleic acids and normal synthetic function (INR/albumin), antiviral therapy is not indicated now.\n\nRemaining uncertainties and what would be clarified with more data: (1) The definitive culprit medication (glyburide vs sitagliptin) — re‑challenge is contraindicated; case reports suggest sulfonylureas can cause hepatocellular DILI, but certainty is limited. (2) Why HBsAg/HBeAg remain positive despite negative molecular testing — additional specialized serologic/neutralization testing or consultation with a reference virology lab/public health could further resolve whether this represents assay artifact or an unusual nonreplicative antigenemia.\n\nRecommended plan (based on above):\n- Final (working) diagnosis: Acute drug‑induced liver injury (most likely glyburide or sitagliptin). Incidental/discordant positive HBsAg/HBeAg without evidence of active HBV replication (HBV DNA and RNA repeatedly undetectable; tissue PCR negative) — treat as nonviremic/low‑risk for active hepatitis at present.\n- Management steps: 1) Do not re‑expose to glyburide or sitagliptin; document drug allergy/suspected DILI in the chart and report adverse event (e.g., MedWatch). 2) Arrange alternative diabetes control (e.g., temporary insulin titration and referral to endocrinology/primary care for long‑term plan). 3) No antiviral therapy for HBV now. 4) Repeat HBsAg, anti‑HBs, anti‑HBc IgM/IgG, and sensitive HBV DNA (PCR) in 1–3 months to reassess; consider sending specimen to a specialized/reference virology lab for HBsAg neutralization or alternative assay if discordance persists. 5) Counsel patient about HBV transmission risk is low given absent viremia, but because HBsAg remains positive on multiple assays, notify public health per local regulations and test/vaccinate household contacts as indicated. 6) Arrange hepatology follow‑up for monitoring and to discuss testing strategy for the discordant HBV serology.\n\nWhy this is final now: The most critical diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties that affected immediate management (cause of transaminitis and need for antivirals) have been resolved: stopping the medications produced prompt biochemical and clinical recovery, and repeated nucleic acid testing (blood and liver) excludes active replicative HBV infection. Further rounds would mainly refine the HBV serology discordance and attempt to identify the specific offending drug, but these do not change immediate management.\n\nIf additional turns available I would: request specialized HBsAg neutralization/alternate‑platform testing and involve public health/virology reference lab; and review pre‑illness medication records to try to attribute causality between glyburide vs sitagliptin using RUCAM/causality assessment.",
