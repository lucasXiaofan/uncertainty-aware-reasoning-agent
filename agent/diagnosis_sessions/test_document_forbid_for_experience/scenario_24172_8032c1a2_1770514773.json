      "action_reason": "A mixing study distinguishes factor deficiency (correction) from an inhibitor (no/full correction then prolongation on incubation for time-dependent inhibitors). Direct factor VIII/IX assays will identify hemophilia A/B. vWF panel assesses for vWD which can lower FVIII and cause mucosal bleeding. dRVVT excludes lupus anticoagulant if mixing suggests an inhibitor; together these tests will differentiate the leading diagnostic possibilities."

Platelet aggregation, secretion, and receptor expression studies can detect Glanzmann thrombasthenia (absent aggregation to all agonists except ristocetin, abnormal GPIIb/IIIa) or storage pool disorders (reduced dense granules/secretion) which may be missed by PFA.
