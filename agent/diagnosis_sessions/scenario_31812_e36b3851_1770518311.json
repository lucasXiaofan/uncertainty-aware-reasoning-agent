would more commonly present earlier or have neonatal history, Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis: Could explain progressive distension and increased irritability as a complication of underlying Hirschsprung.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Suction rectal biopsy (evaluate for absence of ganglion cells and acetylcholinesterase staining)\n\n[Step 9]\nNew Info: Suction rectal biopsy returned normal readings (presence of ganglion cells and normal acetylcholinesterase staining).\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease: Contrast enema showed a transition zone suggesting HD, but a normal suction biopsy argues against classic distal aganglionosis, possible false-negative due to inadequate/superficial sampling., Intussusception (intermittent): Episodes of severe crying and leg-drawing fit intussusception, but abdominal ultrasound was normal and contrast enema did not show a classic target/lead point, transient intussusception could be missed., Colonic pseudo-obstruction (congenital or acquired intestinal dysmotility): Dilated bowel on X-ray with normal biopsy and progressive distension could reflect a motility disorder rather than aganglionosis., Malrotation with intermittent volvulus: Can produce obstructive episodes and distension, though absence of bilious vomiting and normal ultrasound make this less likely.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Full-thickness rectal biopsy to definitively assess for aganglionosis (or repeat biopsy if full-thickness not immediately available).\n\n[Step 10]\nNew Info: Full-thickness rectal biopsy: normal readings (ganglion cells present; acetylcholinesterase staining not suggestive of aganglionosis).\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease: contrast enema shows transition zone suggesting this, but full-thickness biopsy showing ganglion cells makes it unlikely though sampling error/segmental disease is possible, Internal anal sphincter achalasia (IRA)/functional outlet obstruction: can present with distal transition zone and preserved ganglion cells causing failure of relaxation and obstructive symptoms, Distal colonic mechanical obstruction (congenital stricture/stenosis): could produce a transition zone on contrast enema and obstructive x-ray pattern with progressive distension.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Anorectal manometry (to assess presence/absence of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex)\n\n[Step 11]\nNew Info: Anorectal manometry normal — rectoanal inhibitory reflex present.\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease: previously suggested by transition zone on contrast enema but less likely given normal suction and full-thickness biopsies and preserved RAIR on manometry, Distal colonic stricture (congenital or acquired): compatible with transition zone on enema and distal obstruction on X-ray, could be missed on ultrasound and not assessed by ganglion-cell biopsy, Colonic pseudo-obstruction or intestinal neuronal dysplasia: can present with chronic/acute obstruction and may have normal routine biopsies and variable manometry findings, Intermittent intussusception: episodic severe pain fits, but ultrasound was normal and enema showed transition zone rather than classic intussusception—still a remote possibility.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis (pediatric protocol)\n\n[Step 12]\nNew Info: Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis (pediatric protocol) returned normal.\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease: contrast enema showed a transition zone suggesting aganglionosis, but both suction and full-thickness rectal biopsies plus anorectal manometry were normal, making classic Hirschsprung less likely though a short-segment or patchy aganglionosis could rarely be missed, Intussusception (transient/recurrent): history of intermittent severe colicky pain with leg drawing and progressive distension fits, but abdominal ultrasound was normal and air contrast enema did not demonstrate a reducible intussusception — could have been transient and self-reduced, Intermittent malrotation with midgut volvulus: can cause episodic obstruction and pain with dilated bowel on x-ray and may be missed on CT between events, so still possible, Distal colonic stricture/stenosis (congenital or acquired): progressive distension and absence of rectal gas on x-ray compatible, and biopsies would show normal ganglion cells if obstruction is structural rather than neuronal.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Upper GI contrast study (upper GI series) to evaluate for malrotation/midgut volvulus\n\n[Step 13]\nNew Info: Upper GI series normal — no evidence of malrotation or midgut volvulus.\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease: contrast enema shows a distal transition zone compatible with HD, but multiple rectal biopsies and anorectal manometry are normal — possibility of sampling error, transition zone proximal to rectum, or skip lesions, Intestinal neuronal dysplasia / hypoganglionosis: can produce obstructive symptoms and transition-zone appearance but standard biopsies and staining may be inconclusive without specialized assessment, Mechanical distal colonic obstruction (congenital stricture, web, duplication, intraluminal lesion): could explain radiographic transition and obstructive x-ray but may be missed on ultrasound/CT and not detected by rectal biopsy, Intermittent intussusception/volvulus: explains episodic severe pain and obstruction signs but prior imaging (US, contrast studies) is normal, making it less likely.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Surgical full-thickness mapping biopsies of the colon including samples from the transition zone (proximal and distal to it) and send specimens for review by a pediatric GI pathologist with specialized staining and ganglion-cell quantification.\n\n[Step 14]\nNew Info: Surgical full-thickness mapping biopsies of the colon (including proximal and distal to the transition zone) reviewed by a pediatric GI pathologist: normal readings (no evidence of aganglionosis).\nDifferential: Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO): X-ray shows dilated bowel and obstruction physiology but all structural imaging and biopsies are normal, suggesting a primary motility disorder, Hirschsprung disease (atypical/ultrashort-segment or sampling error): contrast enema showed a transition zone but multiple biopsies and manometry are normal—could be false-positive imaging or extremely focal disease, Enteric neuropathy or myopathy (visceral myopathy/neuropathy, intestinal neuronal dysplasia/hypoganglionosis): can produce obstructive symptoms with normal routine histology and require specialized motility and ultrastructural testing, Functional/obstructive constipation or intermittent mechanical obstruction (e.g., transient volvulus/intussusception missed on imaging): clinical course with progressive distension and pain but intermittent nature and lack of vomiting make this less likely.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Antroduodenal manometry\n\n[Step 15]\nNew Info: Antroduodenal manometry returned normal readings (no small-bowel motor abnormality detected).\nDifferential: Hypoganglionosis/intestinal neuronal dysplasia (a Hirschsprung variant): contrast enema shows distal transition zone but multiple biopsies can miss subtle quantitative ganglion cell deficits requiring specialized analysis, Colonic chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO)/colonic dysmotility: imaging shows dilated bowel and obstructive pattern with normal biopsies and normal small-bowel motility, suggesting a primary colonic motor disorder, Cystic fibrosis with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) or inspissated stool: can mimic obstruction in infants and may produce a transition on contrast enema though biopsies would be normal, less likely given normal stools but still possible.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Colonic manometry\n\n[Step 16]\nNew Info: Colonic manometry: Normal readings.\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease (including ultrashort/skip-segment variants): contrast enema showed a transition zone supporting HSCR, but multiple full-thickness biopsies and anorectal manometry were normal, so HSCR remains possible if patchy/segmental or missed by sampling, Intermittent structural obstruction (colonic web/stenosis or intermittent volvulus): plain X-ray shows dilated bowel and absence of rectal gas consistent with obstruction, CT and US normal which could miss an intermittent or intraluminal lesion, Intestinal neuropathy/hypoganglionosis or neuronal intestinal dysplasia: can produce obstruction-like symptoms and transition zones and may be subtle on routine histology—requires quantitative ganglion counts and specialized IHC/genetic correlation.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Genetic testing for Hirschsprung-associated and enteric neuropathy genes (RET, EDNRB, GDNF, SOX10 and a pediatric enteric neuropathy/motility gene panel)\n\n[Step 17]\nNew Info: Genetic testing for Hirschsprung-associated and enteric neuropathy genes (RET, EDNRB, GDNF, SOX10 and enteric neuropathy/motility panel) returned normal.\nDifferential: Hirschsprung disease (ultrashort-segment or skip lesion/sampling error): contrast enema shows transition zone and clinical obstruction fits, but multiple biopsies/manometry/genetics normal so may be missed or ultrashort-segment, Intermittent mechanical obstruction (transient intussusception or intermittent volvulus): episodic severe colicky pain and dilated bowel on x-ray support transient obstruction that could have reduced before imaging, Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (enteric neuropathy/CIPO): imaging shows obstruction without anatomic cause and symptoms fit, but normal motility testing and biopsies make this less certain\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Did he pass meconium within the first 48 hours after birth? Has he had chronic constipation or feeding issues since infancy? Any family history of Hirschsprung disease, bowel motility disorders, or similar symptoms in relatives?\n\n[Step 18]\nNew Info: Patient passed meconium within the first 24 hours after birth, has had no chronic constipation or feeding problems prior to the current 3-day history, and there is no family history of Hirschsprung disease or bowel motility disorders.\nDifferential: Segmental hypoganglionosis / intestinal neuronal dysplasia: may present acutely and can be missed on routine biopsies or require specialized staining/quantification, Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie-like or acute colonic ileus): explains acute progressive distension with normal ganglion cell studies and motility testing early in disease, Intermittent mechanical distal obstruction (stricture, external compression, redundant colon with functional obstruction): could produce a radiographic transition zone and episodic pain but be missed on some imaging.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Neuropathology external reference review of all rectal/colonic biopsy specimens with additional immunohistochemical stains (calretinin, HuC/D), quantitative ganglion cell counts, nerve fiber hypertrophy assessment, and electron microscopy as needed.\n\n[Step 19]\nNew Info: External neuropathology reference review of all rectal/colonic biopsy specimens with additional immunohistochemical stains (calretinin, HuC/D), quantitative ganglion cell counts, nerve fiber hypertrophy assessment, and electron microscopy returned normal.\nDifferential: Patchy/segmented hypoganglionosis or neuronal intestinal dysplasia: contrast enema showed a transition zone and symptoms fit obstructive picture but sampling error or patchy disease could produce normal biopsies, Transient/intermittent intussusception: colicky pain and a radiologic 'transition' can occur with intermittent intussusception that reduced prior to imaging, Pediatric colonic pseudo-obstruction (acute or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction): persistent dilation and obstruction signs with normal histology and manometry could reflect motility failure not captured by tests, Intermittent mechanical obstruction (internal hernia, adhesive band, intermittent midgut volvulus): plain films suggest obstruction but CT/upper GI were normal—intermittent torsion or internal hernia can be missed on static imaging.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Exploratory laparoscopy to inspect for intermittent mechanical obstruction (internal hernia, adhesive bands, intermittent volvulus) and allow intraoperative full-thickness mapping biopsies if suspicious areas identified.",
