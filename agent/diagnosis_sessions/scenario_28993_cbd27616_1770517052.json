The clinical history (hard pellet stools every 3–4 days, marked straining and crying with defecation), symptomatic response to therapeutic cleanout was limited, and absence of systemic or biochemical abnormalities support a diagnosis of severe functional constipation with outlet dysfunction (functional fecal retention) rather than Hirschsprung disease or primary neuropathic/myopathic motility disorder.\n\nI am ready to make a final diagnosis: Severe functional constipation (functional fecal retention / functional outlet obstruction) causing abdominal distension and feeding difficulties. Uncertainties remaining are low probability but include extremely focal/patchy aganglionosis or very rare neuropathies not captured by current testing; these are unlikely given extensive negative testing.\n\nWhat I would still clarify if more rounds were available: detailed feeding/diet history (solids introduction, formula type, fiber/fluids), growth parameters and nutritional assessment, observation for subtle withholding behaviors, and response to a longer therapeutic trial of daily osmotic laxative (PEG) plus scheduled rectal stimulation and bowel regimen. If symptoms remain refractory or red flags arise (failure to thrive, bilious vomiting, persistent radiologic obstruction), re-evaluate with repeat imaging during symptomatic episodes and multidisciplinary surgical review for consideration of alternative diagnoses or targeted interventions (e.g., botulinum injection for internal anal sphincter dysfunction).\n\n## Task:\nProvide a single, specific diagnosis (1-3 words). Examples:\n- \"Acute appendicitis\"\n- \"Community-acquired pneumonia\"\n- \"Type 2 diabetes mellitus\"\n- \"Atrial fibrillation\"\n\nDiagnosis:"
