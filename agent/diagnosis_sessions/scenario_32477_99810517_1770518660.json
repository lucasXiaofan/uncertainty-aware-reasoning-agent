Chronic infection/colonization (including NTM): recurrent antibiotic-treated bronchitis raises possibility of chronic bacterial or nontuberculous mycobacterial infection despite normal CT, Asthma (cough-variant): could cause chronic cough and wheeze but lack of bronchodilator responsiveness and normal PFTs reduce likelihood.\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you have any current or past occupational or home exposures to dust, fumes, chemicals, or biomass smoke, any bird or pet exposures, symptoms of reflux (heartburn/regurgitation), or are you taking an ACE inhibitor?\n\n[Step 11]\nNew Info: Patient denies occupational/home exposures to dust, fumes, chemicals, or biomass smoke; denies bird or pet exposures; denies reflux symptoms; not taking ACE inhibitors.\nDifferential: Bronchiectasis: Copious, chronic morning productive cough and recurrent bronchitis episodes point toward bronchiectasis despite normal HRCT—possible early/segmental disease or false-negative imaging, Chronic bronchitis (non-smoker): Meets chronic productive cough criteria for years, but no smoking history makes typical COPD-related chronic bronchitis less likely though possible idiopathic/other exposures, Immunodeficiency (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia): Recurrent bronchitis and chronic sputum production could reflect impaired host defenses leading to persistent infections, Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) or atypical infection: Chronic productive cough with recurrent infections can be due to NTM, which may not be obvious on routine testing.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Sputum culture and sensitivity including bacterial culture and mycobacterial (AFB) culture\n\n[Step 12]\nNew Info: Sputum culture: heavy growth of non-specific bacteria; no mycobacterial (AFB) or fungal growth; no antibiotic sensitivities reported for the cultured bacteria.\nDifferential: Bronchiectasis: compatible with chronic productive cough and recurrent bacterial infections but contradicted by normal high-resolution CT and absence of clubbing, Humoral immunodeficiency (e.g., CVID): recurrent bacterial bronchitis and heavy bacterial colonization suggest impaired antibody-mediated defense, Chronic bronchitis (non-smoker phenotype): long-term productive cough with recurrent exacerbations fits history despite lack of smoking and normal spirometry, Airway clearance disorder/tracheobronchomalacia: could cause ineffective clearance with recurrent infections and copious sputum, not detected by HRCT alone.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Serum immunoglobulins (quantitative IgG, IgA, IgM) and HIV test\n\n[Step 13]\nNew Info: Serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and HIV test are within normal limits/negative.\nDifferential: Bronchiectasis (right middle lobe): chronic productive cough with recurrent infections and focal crackles over RML suggest bronchiectasis despite a normal HRCT, Chronic bronchitis / chronic suppurative bronchitis (non-smoker): chronic productive cough for 11 years with recurrent bronchitis could represent chronic bronchitic phenotype without smoking history, Primary ciliary dyskinesia (or other mucociliary clearance disorder): lifelong productive cough pattern could reflect a mucociliary defect, though lack of sinusitis/otitis history makes this less likely, Chronic aspiration (silent GERD): recurrent lower respiratory infections and productive cough could be from microaspiration even without typical reflux symptoms.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and airway inspection\n\n[Step 14]\nNew Info: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and airway inspection returned normal findings.\nDifferential: Chronic bronchitis (non-smoker): long-standing productive cough for 11 years with recurrent antibiotic-treated bronchitis and heavy bacterial growth in sputum suggests chronic bronchitic process, Bronchiectasis (early/localized): copious purulent sputum and crackles over RML could reflect bronchiectasis despite a normal HRCT/bronchoscopy (possible early/focal disease or imaging false-negative), Chronic suppurative/colonizing airway infection (including NTM or atypical bacteria): persistent heavy nonspecific bacterial growth and recurrent infections could represent chronic airway colonization or atypical organisms not detected on prior testing, Bronchorrhea from occult mucinous malignancy: profuse watery/foamy sputum raises the possibility of mucus-secreting tumor though normal imaging makes this less likely.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Repeat sputum studies—send for bacterial identification with antibiotic susceptibilities, PCR for NTM and atypical pathogens, and sputum cytology for malignant cells\n\n[Step 15]\nNew Info: Repeat sputum studies (bacterial ID with sensitivities, PCR for NTM and atypical pathogens, and sputum cytology) returned normal.\nDifferential: Chronic bronchitis: long-standing productive cough and recurrent bronchitis episodes despite non-smoking history, Bronchiectasis: compatible with copious morning sputum and recurrent infections but HRCT normal and no digital clubbing make it less likely, Mucinous adenocarcinoma (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma): can cause chronic copious sputum, but normal HRCT, bronchoscopy, and sputum cytology reduce likelihood, Gastroesophageal reflux with chronic microaspiration: can cause chronic productive cough with otherwise normal imaging and tests, and may present without typical reflux symptoms\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you have coughing at night or when lying flat, choking or regurgitation while supine, hoarseness, chronic throat clearing, or a sour/bitter taste in your mouth (symptoms suggesting silent reflux/aspiration)?\n\n[Step 16]\nNew Info: Patient denies nocturnal cough, cough when lying flat, choking/regurgitation when supine, hoarseness, chronic throat clearing, or sour/bitter taste—no symptoms suggestive of reflux/aspiration.\nDifferential: Chronic suppurative bronchitis / chronic bronchitis (non-smoker): long-standing productive cough with heavy non-specific bacterial growth but normal imaging and lung volumes, Bronchiectasis (localized or early): recurrent infections and focal crackles over RML could reflect bronchiectasis despite normal HRCT, Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD): chronic productive cough and recurrent infections could fit but absence of sinus disease and adult onset argue against, Silent gastroesophageal reflux with microaspiration: can be asymptomatic and cause chronic productive cough, but patient denies reflux symptoms\nNext: REQUEST TEST: 24-hour esophageal pH impedance monitoring\n\n[Step 17]\nNew Info: 24-hour esophageal pH impedance monitoring: normal\nDifferential: Chronic bronchitis: fits history of >11 years of productive cough with copious purulent sputum and recurrent antibiotic-treated bronchitis, despite nonsmoking status, Tracheobronchomalacia/dynamic airway collapse: can cause chronic cough and mucus retention with normal static HRCT and routine bronchoscopy that may miss dynamic expiratory collapse, Bronchiectasis: classically explains copious purulent sputum and recurrent infections but HRCT was normal, making it less likely though milder/early disease could be missed, Primary ciliary dyskinesia or other muco-ciliary clearance defect: would explain chronic productive cough but absence of chronic sinus/ear disease and adult onset argue against it\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Dynamic expiratory CT chest (airway protocol) to evaluate for tracheobronchomalacia/expiratory airway collapse\n\n[Step 18]\nNew Info: Dynamic expiratory CT chest (airway protocol) returned normal readings (no tracheobronchomalacia or expiratory airway collapse).\nDifferential: Non-CF bronchiectasis: clinical history of 11 years of copious purulent sputum and recurrent bronchitis fits bronchiectasis, but HRCT is normal which makes typical bronchiectasis less likely though early/small-airway disease can be missed, Chronic (non-smoking) bronchitis: long-standing productive cough and recurrent infections without smoking or exposures supports chronic bronchitic phenotype/airway hypersecretion, Atypical cystic fibrosis (adult-onset or mild CFTR mutations): can present in adulthood with chronic productive cough and recurrent infections despite normal imaging, Primary ciliary dyskinesia: explains chronic productive cough and infections, but lack of chronic sinusitis/ear disease and absent situs make it less likely though not excluded.\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic testing\n\n[Step 19]\nNew Info: Sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic testing returned normal readings.\nDifferential: Chronic bronchitis (chronic productive cough and recurrent bronchitis fits chronic bronchitic phenotype despite non-smoking history, normal imaging does not exclude chronic bronchitis), Bronchiectasis (copious, purulent sputum and recurrent infections are typical, but high-resolution CT was normal arguing against established bronchiectasis, may be early/focal disease or missed), Primary ciliary dyskinesia (can cause long-standing productive cough from impaired mucociliary clearance, but lack of chronic sinusitis/otitis and normal bronchoscopy make it less likely), Specific antibody deficiency (normal quantitative Ig levels but recurrent bacterial bronchitis and heavy non-specific bacterial growth in sputum suggest possible functional antibody defect)\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Specific antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (measure serotype-specific IgG titers pre-immunization and 4–6 weeks post-immunization)",
