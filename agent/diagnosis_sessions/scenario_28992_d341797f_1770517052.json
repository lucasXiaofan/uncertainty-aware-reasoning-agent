Thrombin generation assay and fibrinolysis tests (ECLT, plasminogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin, PAP complexes) assess hyperfibrinolysis, which can cause bleeding despite normal routine tests.

      "action_reason": "After an extensive, stepwise evaluation including CBC, coagulation panel (PT/INR, multiple aPTT measurements with immediate and incubated 1:1 mixing and repeat external reagent), comprehensive factor assays (II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XIII), vWF testing (antigen, activity, multimer, collagen binding, RIPA), platelet studies (count, PFA-100, light-transmission aggregation with multiple agonists, lumi-aggregometry/ATP secretion, flow cytometry for GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb, electron microscopy for dense granules, shear-based assays), fibrinolysis testing (ECLT, plasminogen activity, alpha2-antiplasmin, PAP complexes), thrombin generation, antiphospholipid and lupus anticoagulant testing, anti-Xa, genetic sequencing for F8/F9 and VWF and extended platelet-gene panel, and targeted testing for contact factors — all of which returned normal — there is no laboratory evidence for a defined coagulation factor deficiency, von Willebrand disease, platelet structural or functional disorder, systemic hyperfibrinolysis, inhibitor, or antiphospholipid syndrome. Clinically, the patient has mucosal bleeding from a dental extraction that responded to topical and systemic tranexamic acid and a history of easy bruising with positive family history (uncle) for bruising/joint issues but no clear connective-tissue stigmata.\n\nMost likely diagnosis: Bleeding disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) — most consistent with: 1) localized oral-site hyperfibrinolysis contributing to prolonged post-extraction bleeding (supported by good response to topical/systemic tranexamic acid) and/or 2) a mild, inherited bleeding tendency below the detection threshold of current laboratory assays (subclinical/qualitative platelet or vessel-wall defect). \n\nWhy other causes are unlikely: Hemophilia A/B, factor deficiencies, vWD (all quantitative/qualitative tests normal), platelet count/major platelet function disorders, fibrinolytic system disorders, inhibitors, antiphospholipid antibody–mediated coagulopathy, and liver disease have been effectively excluded by the above testing and clinical history. A connective tissue disorder (e.g., Ehlers–Danlos) is less likely given lack of skin hyperextensibility, abnormal scarring, or joint hypermobility, though a mild familial connective-tissue variant cannot be absolutely excluded.\n\nRemaining uncertainties and what would clarify them: Intermittent or very mild platelet/vWF dysfunction or rare/novel genetic variants not covered by panels; small-vessel/vascular fragility not yet demonstrated on exam/skin biopsy; and confirmation of family segregation. To resolve these, I would pursue: family member targeted testing during bleeding episodes, extended genomic testing (whole-exome/genome with research referral), skin biopsy and dermatology/genetics evaluation for mild connective-tissue disease if clinical suspicion persists, and prospective documentation of bleeding phenotype (repeat ISTH-BAT if new events). \n\nPractical recommendations: continue topical/systemic tranexamic acid for ongoing/episodic mucosal bleeding and as prophylaxis (eg, oral TXA mouthwash or oral TXA 1 g TID starting the day of and for 3 days after future dental procedures), use local hemostatic measures (suture, oxidized cellulose/gelatin sponge, topical fibrin sealant) and avoid NSAIDs/aspirin. Provide written guidance for peri-procedural management and consider prophylactic TXA for minor procedures. Arrange continued follow-up at a hereditary bleeding disorders clinic and offer family-member evaluation. Provide urgent reassessment if bleeding worsens, hematuria, melena, hypotension, or thrombotic symptoms develop. ",
