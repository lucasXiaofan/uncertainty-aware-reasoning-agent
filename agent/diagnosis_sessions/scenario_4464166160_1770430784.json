    "Hemarthrosis from an inherited bleeding disorder (e.g., hemophilia)": "family history of an uncle with similar knee swelling and ultrasound suggestive of hemarthrosis, but extensive coagulation testing (including F8/F9 sequencing), synovial RBCs, and hematology consult were normal",
    "Traumatic/post‑traumatic joint effusion": "recent park play without reported trauma, mild symptoms and preserved function make a simple traumatic effusion likely",
    "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (monoarticular JIA or early oligoarticular JIA)": "monoarticular swelling in a toddler can present like this, though ESR/CRP are normal and there is no morning stiffness reported",
    "Occult intra‑articular structural injury (osteochondral lesion) or transient synovitis": "MRI was normal, making structural lesion less likely, but some lesions can be occult early on."
