Also have you had any transient focal neurological symptoms (vision change, slurred speech, limb weakness/numbness) since the vertigo started?\n\n[Step 11]\nNew Info: Patient reports no vascular risk factors (no hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, or smoking), is not on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, and has had no transient focal neurological symptoms (no vision changes, slurred speech, weakness, or numbness) since vertigo onset.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: post-viral continuous vertigo and recent URI support this peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (head impulse, vHIT, calorics) have been normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo with normal MRI/audiometry/vestibular testing though patient lacks prior migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: normal MRI and lack of vascular risk factors lower likelihood but central cause remains a concern because of persistent vertigo with normal peripheral testing\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Comprehensive neurological exam including cranial nerve assessment, cerebellar testing (finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin), Romberg test, and gait assessment\n\n[Step 12]\nNew Info: Neuro exam: spontaneous nystagmus present; bedside bilateral decreased hearing reported; unstable tandem gait but baseline gait largely unremarkable; finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin normal; Romberg normal.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (head impulse, vHIT, calorics) were normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo and normal MRI/audiology though patient denies migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: persistent vertigo with nystagmus and gait instability raises central concern despite prior negative MRI, Labyrinthitis: would explain vertigo with hearing changes but prior diagnostic audiometry was normal making it less likely\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography of the posterior circulation (posterior fossa protocol)\n\n[Step 13]\nNew Info: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography of the posterior circulation returned normal — no acute ischemia or vascular abnormality.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support peripheral vestibulopathy, but normal head impulse and vestibular testing argue against unilateral peripheral hypofunction; Vestibular migraine: can present with acute vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing, patient denies prior migraine history but first presentation is possible; Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke/ischemia: central cause remains possible despite normal MRI/MRA (small/early infarct or transient ischemia) but likelihood reduced by imaging and lack of focal deficits.\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you currently have a headache, sensitivity to light or sound (photophobia/phonophobia), visual aura, or a family history of migraine?\n\n[Step 14]\nNew Info: Patient denies current headache, photophobia, phonophobia, visual aura, and has no family history of migraine.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo fit a peripheral post-viral cause but objective vestibular tests (HIT, vHIT, calorics) were normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo and normal imaging/testing though patient lacks migraine history or typical migrainous features, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: central cause less likely given two negative MRIs/MRA and lack of focal deficits but persistent vertigo with normal peripheral testing keeps residual concern\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Since the dizziness started this morning, have your symptoms improved, stayed the same, or worsened? Also, have you ever had similar episodes of vertigo in the past?\n\n[Step 15]\nNew Info: Symptoms have stayed the same since onset this morning — constant low-grade spinning with occasional nausea; diphenhydramine helped slightly; no prior similar episodes.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo fit a post-viral peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (HIT, vHIT, calorics) have been normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing despite no prior migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: central cause remains possible given normal head-impulse and persistent vertigo, but two negative MRIs/MRA and lack of vascular risk factors reduce likelihood\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Have you taken any new medications or recreational drugs, consumed alcohol recently, experienced recent head trauma, or noticed ear fullness or changes in hearing since the symptoms began?\n\n[Step 16]\nNew Info: Patient reports no new prescription medications or recreational drugs, no recent alcohol, no head trauma, no ear fullness, and no perceived change in hearing since symptom onset; has taken diphenhydramine which provides slight symptomatic relief.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support a post-viral peripheral vestibulopathy but expected unilateral hypofunction was not seen on bedside and instrumented vestibular testing, Vestibular migraine: can present with acute persistent vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing despite no prior migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke or transient ischemia: normal head-impulse with spontaneous nystagmus and persistent vertigo raises central concern though two negative MRIs/MRA and lack of vascular risk factors lower probability\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging in 24-48 hours\n\n[Step 17]\nNew Info: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging performed 24-48 hours after onset is normal (no acute ischemia or vascular abnormality).\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support a peripheral post-viral vestibulopathy, but bedside and instrumented vestibular tests (HIT, vHIT, calorics) have been normal; Vestibular migraine: can present with persistent vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing despite no prior migraine history; Central posterior circulation ischemia/stroke: two negative MRIs/MRA lower likelihood but small/early infarct or transient ischemia remains possible given persistent vertigo and normal peripheral vestibular testing; Bilateral vestibulopathy/other peripheral causes: less typical due to acute continuous vertigo and normal vestibular testing but still a consideration\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Rotatory chair testing (complete vestibular function testing, including sinusoidal harmonic acceleration and VEMP if available)\n\n[Step 18]\nNew Info: Rotatory chair testing (complete vestibular function testing, including sinusoidal harmonic acceleration and VEMP if available) returned normal readings.\nDifferential: Vestibular migraine: can cause persistent vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular tests, though patient denies migraine history; Vestibular neuritis (atypical): recent URI and continuous vertigo support peripheral post-viral vestibulopathy but normal HIT, vHIT, calorics, and rotatory chair argue against typical unilateral hypofunction; Posterior circulation ischemia/stroke/vertebrobasilar TIA: persistent vertigo with normal peripheral tests and normal HINTS keeps central cause possible despite two negative MRIs/MRA and low vascular risk; Otolith-specific vestibular dysfunction (utricle/saccule) or superior/inferior division lesion: could explain symptoms with normal semicircular canal tests and may be detected by VEMP testing\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Cervical and ocular VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potentials) testing\n\n[Step 19]\nNew Info: Cervical and ocular VEMP testing returned normal readings.\nDifferential: Vestibular migraine: persistent vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular tests fits though patient lacks migraine history, Atypical vestibular neuritis/post-viral vestibulopathy: recent URI and continuous vertigo support this but extensive vestibular testing (HIT, vHIT, calorics, rotatory chair, VEMP) were normal arguing against typical unilateral hypofunction, Posterior circulation ischemia/stroke/TIA: central cause remains possible given normal peripheral vestibular testing and persistent vertigo but two repeat MRIs/MRA negative and low vascular risk make it less likely, Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)/visual vertigo: may follow an acute event and present with dizziness worsened by visual motion—fits normal objective tests and persistent symptoms though usually more subacute/chronic\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do your dizziness symptoms worsen with visual motion or busy environments (e.g., crowds, scrolling on a screen), or when standing/walking, and have you experienced increased anxiety or stress since symptom onset?",
