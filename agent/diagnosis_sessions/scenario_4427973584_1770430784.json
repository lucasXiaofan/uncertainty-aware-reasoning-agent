      "action_reason": "Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2) and basic demographics are essential early data: fever would raise suspicion for infectious hepatitis; hemodynamic instability would change urgency; tachycardia/fever suggest systemic infection; oxygenation and perfusion status affect next steps.

Eliciting specific uncommon exposures (mushrooms, industrial toxins, tattoos, supplements) targets causes that could explain isolated severe ALT elevation despite the current serologies; this helps differentiate acute HBV immune-mediated injury from DILI or other toxic/metabolic causes and will inform whether to start empiric antiviral therapy or order targeted tests (e.g., ceruloplasmin/urine copper, toxin screens, or liver biopsy)."

Empiric nucleos(t)ide therapy may reduce hepatic injury risk and is recommended by hepatology in this clinical context; frequent monitoring and early transplant evaluation will detect worsening synthetic function and guide escalation.

    "Patient reports worsening jaundice and persistent extreme fatigue today; mild diffuse abdominal tenderness continues. Labs show markedly isolated ALT elevation (~2,000 IU/L) with normal AST, normal bilirubin and INR, and positive HBsAg with anti-HBc IgM (consistent with acute HBV); repeated HBV DNA tests so far reported as normal/undetectable.",
    "Persistent, isolated severe ALT elevation (~2,000 IU/L) with normal AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and INR on repeated testing; initial serologies showed HBsAg positive and anti-HBc IgM positive but multiple HBV DNA assays (including sensitive PCR) repeatedly undetectable; patient reports worsening yellow skin and persistent extreme fatigue.",
    "Confirmed acute hepatitis B: HBsAg positive (confirmed on repeat assays including neutralization), anti-HBc IgM positive, with markedly elevated ALT (~2,000 IU/L) but repeatedly undetectable/very low HBV DNA on sensitive assays. Total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, INR, CBC, hemolysis labs, and abdominal ultrasound are all normal. No encephalopathy; hepatology consulted.",
    "Confirmed acute hepatitis B serology: HBsAg positive (confirmed by neutralization) and anti-HBc IgM positive, with persistently undetectable HBV DNA on multiple sensitive platforms. Marked isolated transaminitis (ALT ~2,000 IU/L) persisting on serial measures. AST, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, INR, CBC, hemolysis labs, CK, autoimmune panel, and extensive viral testing (HAV, HEV, EBV, CMV, HSV) are normal/negative. Patient clinically stable without encephalopathy; abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness only. Hepatology reconsult recommended empiric antiviral therapy given severe transaminitis.",
    "25-year-old male with confirmed acute hepatitis B serology (HBsAg positive, anti-HBc IgM positive on repeat and confirmatory assays) presenting with marked isolated ALT elevation (≈2,000 IU/L) with persistently normal AST, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, INR, CBC, CK, hemolysis labs, abdominal ultrasound, autoimmune and other viral serologies; sensitive quantitative HBV DNA repeatedly undetectable across platforms.",
    "Urgent liver biopsy reported as normal. Persistently positive HBsAg with anti-HBc IgM but repeatedly undetectable sensitive HBV DNA; ALT remains markedly elevated (~2,000 IU/L) while AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and INR remain normal.",
    "Reference laboratory confirms markedly elevated ALT 2,000 IU/L by alternate methodology; HBsAg positive confirmed by neutralization/alternate platforms; anti-HBc IgM positive; sensitive HBV DNA repeatedly undetectable.",
    "Empiric antiviral therapy (tenofovir or entecavir) has been initiated per hepatology recommendation; ALT remains markedly elevated at ~2,000 IU/L on repeat testing while AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, INR, and clinical encephalopathy assessment remain normal.",
    "25-year-old male with 2-day history of fatigue and jaundice. Persistent, marked ALT elevation (~2,000 IU/L) confirmed by repeat testing and reference laboratory/alternate assay; AST, Alk Phos, total and direct bilirubin, INR, CBC, CK, hemolysis labs, and hepatic synthetic function remain normal. HBsAg positive and anti-HBc IgM positive on multiple confirmatory platforms; sensitive HBV DNA (real-time PCR) repeatedly undetectable on local and reference assays; HBsAg quantification and genotype testing performed. Extensive serologic workup for other viral causes (HAV, HCV, HEV, EBV, CMV, HSV), autoimmune hepatitis panel, Wilson disease testing (ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, slit-lamp), abdominal ultrasound, and liver biopsy have not identified an alternative cause. Empiric antiviral therapy (tenofovir or entecavir) has been started and transplant evaluation arranged given severe transaminitis; patient remains clinically stable but markedly fatigued with worsening jaundice."

  "current_uncertainties": {
    "Acute hepatitis B (true acute infection causing immune-mediated hepatocellular injury)": "HBsAg + and anti-HBc IgM + support this, but repeatedly undetectable HBV DNA is unexpected and raises uncertainty",
    "Occult/undisclosed acetaminophen toxicity (acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular injury)": "high ALT and normal acetaminophen level can occur if ingestion was remote—would respond to N-acetylcysteine",
    "Idiosyncratic drug- or toxin-induced liver injury (herbal/supplement/industrial exposure)": "history negative but could be undisclosed and can present with marked ALT elevation",
    "Seronegative autoimmune or atypical viral/rare causes": "less likely given negative testing and biopsy, but not fully excluded."
