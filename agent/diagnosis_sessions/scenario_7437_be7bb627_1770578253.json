        "3) Atelectasis": "common postop cause of fever and cough, often less sputum production and less pleuritic pain",
        "4) Aspiration pneumonia": "perioperative aspiration risk can present with fever, cough, and focal infiltrate."
      },
      "reference_relevance": "Guidelines were helpful: they emphasize early collection of vital signs and timing of symptom onset to differentiate pneumonia, atelectasis, PE, and aspiration; recommend focused history (smoking, aspiration risk) and imaging/labs when suspicion for pneumonia or PE exists.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Vital Signs",
      "action_reason": "Vital signs (temperature, HR, BP, RR, SpO2) are essential early data to assess severity, detect hypoxia/tachycardia suggestive of PE or pneumonia, and guide next steps (oxygen, urgent imaging, blood tests). They will help discriminate between infectious and thromboembolic causes and prioritize further testing."

        "Postoperative bacterial pneumonia": "fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain suggests lung parenchymal infection",
        "Pulmonary embolism": "postoperative state with pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia could indicate PE",
        "Atelectasis": "common postoperative cause of fever and cough, often occurs earlier and may produce less productive sputum"
      },
      "reference_relevance": "Guideline search returned relevant prior cases showing that timing of symptom onset, aspiration risk, and smoking history help differentiate postoperative pneumonia vs atelectasis vs PE. The guidelines are helpful but limited here because imaging (CXR/CT) and physical exam findings are not yet available.",
      "action": "ASK PATIENT: When did your fever and productive cough begin relative to your surgery? Did you have any vomiting, loss of consciousness, or difficult/intubation events around the operation (possible aspiration)? Do you currently smoke—if so, how many cigarettes per day? Any new shortness of breath, leg pain, or swelling?",
      "action_reason": "Symptom timing helps distinguish pneumonia (typically 48–72 hr post-op) from immediate atelectasis or aspiration. Aspiration history increases likelihood of aspiration pneumonia. Smoking status increases pneumonia risk. Leg symptoms/SOB screen for PE risk and would prompt urgent imaging if present."

      "reference_relevance": "Helpful: guideline experiences emphasize chest x-ray early to distinguish pneumonia vs atelectasis and the importance of timing (48–72 h) and smoking as risk factor; partially limited because PE cannot be excluded by CXR and may require further imaging if clinical suspicion increases.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Chest X-ray (portable AP upright if patient cannot stand; include lateral view if possible)",
      "action_reason": "A chest x-ray will identify lobar consolidation suggesting postoperative pneumonia, distinguish atelectasis or small effusion, and help decide need for antibiotics versus conservative pulmonary toilet. It is the next high-yield test to narrow the differential between pneumonia and atelectasis."

      "reference_relevance": "Relevant guideline experiences support that a focal basilar infiltrate with fever and productive cough in a postoperative smoker most likely represents postoperative bacterial pneumonia; guidelines note that atelectasis is common but usually presents earlier and with less systemic signs, and that aspiration is considered with perioperative events. Past experiences recommend focused respiratory exam, pulse oximetry, CBC, and sputum studies to distinguish these.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Respiratory exam (lung auscultation) and pulse oximetry; order CBC with differential and sputum Gram stain and culture.",
      "action_reason": "A focused respiratory exam and pulse oximetry assess oxygenation and localizing signs (eg, bronchial breath sounds, crackles) supporting pneumonia versus atelectasis or PE. CBC quantifies leukocytosis supporting infection. Sputum Gram stain/culture may identify a pathogen to guide antibiotics and help distinguish bacterial pneumonia from noninfectious causes."

Procalcitonin was noted in past cases to help distinguish bacterial infection from atelectasis/viral illness.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Procalcitonin",
      "action_reason": "Procalcitonin level helps differentiate bacterial pneumonia (typically elevated) from noninfectious postop causes like atelectasis (typically low). A low procalcitonin would lower the probability of bacterial pneumonia and avoid unnecessary broad antibiotics; an elevated level would support starting empiric antibiotics and obtaining blood cultures."

Overall the guidance supports viral testing before empiric antibiotics in a hemodynamically stable patient.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Respiratory viral PCR (nasopharyngeal swab)",
      "action_reason": "A positive viral PCR would support a viral etiology (explaining normal procalcitonin and negative sputum) and reduce the need for antibiotics; a negative result would increase the likelihood of bacterial pneumonia and prompt consideration of empiric antibiotics and/or chest CT to further characterize the infiltrate."

        "Aspiration pneumonia": "perioperative aspiration unlikely given no events but still possible"
      },
      "reference_relevance": "Helpful: Past experiences emphasize that postoperative pneumonia typically appears 48-72 hours post-op with focal consolidation and leukocytosis; procalcitonin and viral PCR normal make viral causes and systemic bacterial infection less likely but do not exclude localized bacterial pneumonia. Some experiences note that negative sputum cultures are common if antibiotics given or poor sample.",

      "action_reason": "Blood cultures can detect bacteremia from postoperative pneumonia and guide antibiotic therapy; CT chest can rule out pulmonary embolism if clinical suspicion persists given pleuritic chest pain, but current features favor pneumonia. This helps distinguish bacterial pneumonia from PE or noninfectious causes."

        "Pulmonary embolism": "pleuritic chest pain possible but CTPA not performed and SpO2 normal making PE less likely"
      },
      "reference_relevance": "Helpful — prior guideline experiences emphasize collecting perioperative antibiotic history and precise symptom timing and suggest CT imaging if diagnosis remains uncertain. These are applicable here because procalcitonin and sputum cultures are non-diagnostic and precise medication history may explain negative cultures.",
      "action": "ASK PATIENT: Did you receive perioperative or postoperative antibiotics? If yes, which antibiotics, what dose, and for how long? Have you taken any antibiotics since your surgery?",
      "action_reason": "Recent antibiotic exposure could suppress sputum and blood cultures and lower procalcitonin, making bacterial pneumonia harder to detect. Knowing this will help interpret negative microbiology and decide whether further imaging (CT chest) or empiric antibiotics are needed to differentiate bacterial pneumonia from atelectasis."

      },
      "reference_relevance": "Helpful — Past guideline experiences align with this case where postoperative pneumonia is most likely given timing and focal infiltrate; however, normal procalcitonin and negative sputum decrease confidence in bacterial infection. CTPA is suggested when PE is in differential; chest CT can better distinguish consolidation vs atelectasis and detect effusion/empyema.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: CT chest with contrast (CT pulmonary angiography)",
      "action_reason": "A contrast chest CT (CTPA) will (1) exclude pulmonary embolism/pulmonary infarct as the cause of pleuritic pain and focal infiltrate, (2) better characterize the RLL opacity to distinguish lobar pneumonia vs atelectasis vs early empyema/abscess, and (3) assess for pleural effusion that may require drainage — findings that will direct whether to start/modify antibiotics or pursue alternative treatments."

      "action": "ASK PATIENT: Is your sputum purulent (yellow/green) or bloody? Approximately how much sputum do you produce (small amount with cough, copious), and have you been using your incentive spirometer and mobilizing/ambulating after surgery? Also, have you had any prior chest infections or chronic lung disease?",
      "action_reason": "Purulent or bloody sputum and copious production favors bacterial pneumonia, while scant/nonpurulent sputum and poor mobilization/inadequate incentive spirometry would suggest postoperative atelectasis. Prior lung disease increases baseline risk for infectious complications. This targeted history will help differentiate between bacterial pneumonia versus noninfectious atelectasis and guide need for antibiotics or additional imaging (eg, chest ultrasound for effusion/empyema)."

      "reference_relevance": "Guideline experiences were helpful: they support postoperative pneumonia as the leading diagnosis given timing (48–72 hours post-op), focal infiltrate, purulent sputum, and leukocytosis. However, normal procalcitonin and negative sputum culture reduce—but do not exclude—bacterial infection. Guidelines recommend noninvasive antigen testing when sputum is nondiagnostic and point-of-care imaging (pleural ultrasound) to evaluate for effusion/empyema; both would help here.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Urine antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila",
      "action_reason": "Urine antigen tests are rapid and can identify common bacterial pathogens when sputum Gram stain/culture are nondiagnostic. A positive result would support bacterial postoperative pneumonia and guide targeted antibiotic therapy; a negative result would lower the likelihood of those pathogens and support consideration of noninfectious causes (atelectasis) or atypical organisms, informing next steps."

Given normal procalcitonin and negative sputum culture, these negatives lower the probability of typical CAP but do not rule out focal bacterial pneumonia or empyema. Lung ultrasound can provide additional bedside diagnostic discrimination.",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Chest ultrasound (lung ultrasound)",
      "action_reason": "Bedside lung ultrasound can distinguish consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms (supporting pneumonia) from atelectasis (static air bronchograms) and identify small pleural effusions or early empyema that may not be apparent on portable CXR or CT. This will help differentiate bacterial pneumonia/aspiration from postoperative atelectasis and guide whether to begin or broaden antibiotics or pursue drainage."

Rationale: Fever began on postoperative day 3 (48–72 hours), productive purulent sputum, marked fever (39°C), leukocytosis, focal right‑lower‑lobe infiltrate on chest x‑ray and inspiratory crackles at the same location support a localized pulmonary infection. Pulmonary embolism is unlikely (CTPA normal, normal oxygenation), and pleural empyema is unlikely (chest ultrasound shows no effusion).
