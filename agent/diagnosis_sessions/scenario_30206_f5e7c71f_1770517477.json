      "reference_relevance": "Not helpful—query returned no relevant guidelines; however prior steps and responses provide evidence of partial response to antibiotics and airway clearance suggesting chronic bacterial bronchitis is likely, while repeated normal imaging and bronchoscopy argue against bronchiectasis and structural disease. ENT normal reduces likelihood of laryngopharyngeal reflux/laryngeal hypersensitivity but does not exclude cough hypersensitivity.",
      "action": "ASK PATIENT: You've had an 11-year history of productive cough with thick yellow-green sputum and partial improvement with antibiotics and airway clearance. Are you experiencing significant daily quality-of-life impairment from the cough now (rate 0–10, 10 worst)? Also, are you open to trying neuromodulator therapy (e.g., gabapentin) next, given ENT is normal, or would you prefer continued longer-term macrolide therapy/rotating antibiotics versus inhaled antibiotics—do you have preferences, concerns, or plans for pregnancy? Any antibiotic allergies?",
      "action_reason": "This question helps decide whether to pursue neuromodulator therapy for cough hypersensitivity versus long-term antimicrobial strategies for chronic bacterial bronchitis and ensures safety (pregnancy plans/allergies) and patient preferences guide the next steps."

      "reference_relevance": "Guidelines not found from query_medical_guidelines; prior experiences not directly applicable but standard diagnostic steps (exclude bronchiectasis, immunodeficiency, GERD, laryngeal causes) have been done and mostly normal; empiric therapies produced partial response suggesting mixed phenotype (infectious component + hypersensitivity).",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Start trial of gabapentin 300 mg nightly, titrate as tolerated to 300 mg TID over 2–4 weeks for 8–12 weeks to assess cough hypersensitivity syndrome; continue airway clearance and consider maintenance macrolide if symptoms recur after neuromodulator trial.",
      "action_reason": "Gabapentin addresses cough hypersensitivity when structural/infectious causes are largely excluded and ENT is normal; patient consents and prior infection-directed therapies gave only partial improvement, so neuromodulator trial can clarify neurogenic contribution while continuing airway clearance; monitor for side effects and reassess cough score and sputum."
