        "Postoperative pneumonia": "productive cough and fever suggest lower respiratory tract infection localized to lung",
        "Pulmonary embolism (PE)": "postoperative state and pleuritic chest pain raise risk for PE, which may present with fever and pleuritic pain but often with hypoxia/tachycardia",
        "Atelectasis with superimposed infection": "common after surgery causing fever and cough but usually less purulent sputum and milder pleuritic pain",

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Vital Signs",
      "action_reason": "Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO2) and basic demographics (age, sex) are essential early data to distinguish causes: hypoxia/tachycardia would increase suspicion for PE or pneumonia; high fever and focal oxygenation impairment favor pneumonia/empyema; normal vitals make severe PE less likely. This will guide next targeted tests (CXR, D-dimer/CTPA, CBC, sputum cultures)."

      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Chest X-ray",
      "action_reason": "A chest X-ray is the next high-yield test to detect pulmonary consolidation (supporting pneumonia), pleural effusion or empyema, and lobar collapse/atelectasis. A normal or non-diagnostic CXR would raise suspicion for PE and prompt further testing (D-dimer/CTA)."

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: CBC with differential and blood cultures",
      "action_reason": "CBC will help confirm an inflammatory/infectious response (leukocytosis with left shift supports pneumonia over PE/atelectasis). Blood cultures can detect bacteremia and guide empiric antibiotic choices; both will help differentiate infectious vs noninfectious causes and inform urgent management."

      "action_reason": "Sputum Gram stain and culture can identify a causative organism and support bacterial pneumonia diagnosis versus noninfectious causes (atelectasis or PE). Positive bacterial findings would guide empiric antibiotic selection and differentiate pneumonia/empyema from other postoperative causes. Blood cultures are pending and will complement sputum results."

      },
      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Physical Exam (Chest auscultation and pleural exam)",
      "action_reason": "A focused chest physical exam (inspection, percussion, auscultation for crackles, bronchial breath sounds, egophony, decreased breath sounds or dullness) will help discriminate pneumonia vs atelectasis vs pleural effusion/empyema and identify findings less typical for isolated PE; results guide whether to pursue thoracic ultrasound/chest CT (CTPA) or targeted thoracentesis."

        "Atelectasis or bronchial obstruction": "common post-op, can produce fever and base infiltrate/opacity and crackles, but usually less productive cough and lower-grade fever",
        "Pleural empyema/effusion": "pleuritic pain and localized infiltrate could reflect complicated parapneumonic effusion though physical exam would often show dullness/decreased breath sounds (not yet documented)."

      "action": "REQUEST TEST: CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)",
      "action_reason": "CTPA will identify or exclude pulmonary embolism (a key alternative given postoperative status and pleuritic pain) and simultaneously provide detailed imaging of the lung parenchyma and pleural space to better distinguish consolidation from atelectasis or effusion/empyema, thereby guiding management (anticoagulation vs antibiotics vs drainage)."

        "Pulmonary embolism": "less likely given normal CTPA, but small/subsegmental PE or alternative pleural infarction cannot be completely excluded",
        "Postoperative atelectasis": "can cause fever and CXR changes post-op, but productive cough, high fever, leukocytosis and consolidation favor infection."

      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Pleural (thoracic) ultrasound",
      "action_reason": "Ultrasound will detect pleural effusion or loculations suggesting parapneumonic effusion/empyema and differentiate effusion from consolidation; this finding would change management (e.g., need for drainage) and further supports or refutes pneumonia vs atelectasis vs pleural process given CTPA is normal."

        "Aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia": "plausible in postoperative setting with right lower-lobe infiltrate, timing and history of aspiration unclear",
        "Postoperative atelectasis": "common after surgery and can cause fever and CXR opacity, but productive cough, high fever, and leukocytosis favor infection."
      },
      "reference_relevance": "No relevant information retrieved",
      "action": "REQUEST TEST: Procalcitonin",
      "action_reason": "A procalcitonin level will help differentiate bacterial pneumonia (likely elevated) from non-infectious causes such as atelectasis or pulmonary embolism (usually low). This will guide need for continued/targeted antibiotics and help interpret negative sputum culture and pending blood cultures."

        "Aspiration pneumonia": "postoperative setting and right lower lobe localization are typical for aspiration, may have negative routine sputum Gram stain and low procalcitonin early",
        "Atypical or viral pneumonia": "normal procalcitonin and negative sputum gram stain increase likelihood of non-bacterial pathogens",

      "action_reason": "A history of perioperative intubation or witnessed/likely aspiration would raise suspicion for aspiration pneumonia (anaerobic organisms, different empiric therapy) and help distinguish it from typical bacterial or atypical/viral pneumonia; absence of aspiration risk favors community-acquired/postoperative bacterial or atypical causes and would guide next diagnostic tests (e.g., urine antigens, repeat cultures) and management."

      "action_reason": "Surgery type and postoperative day strongly influence likelihood of atelectasis versus pneumonia/aspiration (early post-op and upper abdominal/thoracic surgery favor atelectasis/aspiration; later onset favors pneumonia). Smoking or chronic lung disease increases pneumonia risk and may affect management."
