The patient’s reported yellow skin was not supported biochemically (normal total and direct bilirubin, negative urine bilirubin/urobilinogen), making true jaundice unlikely.\n\nDiagnostic conclusion: The most likely explanation is laboratory error or transient assay interference producing a spurious isolated ALT elevation and a false‑positive HBV serology result; the patient does not have biochemically evident hepatitis or active hepatitis B. The patient’s yellow skin is unlikely to be true jaundice and is more consistent with nonhepatic pigmentation (eg, carotenemia) or perception. \n\nWhy uncertainties were resolved: Multiple independent high‑sensitivity and alternate‑platform assays, tissue testing (biopsy), and broad infectious/metabolic testing failed to reproduce the initial abnormal results, making persistent or clinically significant hepatic injury and active HBV extremely unlikely. Normal bilirubin and INR argue strongly against clinically important hepatocellular dysfunction.\n\nRemaining uncertainties and recommended follow‑up: 1) Very early or resolving acute HBV with transient serologic fluctuation is theoretically possible but unlikely given repeated negative HBV DNA and negative confirmatory HBsAg; repeat HBV serology (HBsAg, total anti‑HBc) and HBV DNA once more at 8–12 weeks can definitively exclude seroconversion patterns. 2) Cause of perceived yellow skin—measure fasting carotene level or ask about high‑beta‑carotene diet/topicals and consider thyroid function tests; dermatology photo/exam if persistent. 3) If ALT elevations recur, repeat LFTs, CK, and evaluate for intermittent exposures or rare intermittent hepatotoxins; consider repeat liver biopsy only if persistent biochemical/hepatic dysfunction.\n\nImmediate management: Reassure the patient that life‑threatening causes are very unlikely based on extensive testing. Advise avoiding alcohol and hepatotoxins, with return precautions for worsening fatigue, abdominal pain, dark urine, pale stools, new confusion, or any signs of hepatic decompensation. If patient is seronegative and susceptible to HBV (no reliable vaccination or anti‑HBs), offer HBV vaccination series. Arrange follow‑up LFTs and repeat HBV serology/HBV DNA in 8–12 weeks to confirm resolution and finalize documentation for public‑health concerns related to the initial positive result.\n\nWhat I would still clarify with additional rounds: a focused skin exam or photograph to confirm carotenemia vs true jaundice, dietary history for carotenoid intake, and final repeat HBV serology and HBV DNA at 8–12 weeks to close the diagnostic loop.",

HBV DNA remained undetectable on high-sensitivity PCR; confirmatory HBsAg testing performed (results previously inconsistent). Patient clinically well; total and direct bilirubin remain normal; urine dip negative for bilirubin.\n\n## Clinician's Assessment:\nSummary of evidence: Initial labs showed isolated marked ALT elevation (2,000 IU/L) and positive HBsAg with IgM anti‑HBc, suggesting acute HBV. However, repeated and highly sensitive/alternate-platform testing repeatedly failed to corroborate active infection or persistent transaminitis: high‑sensitivity HBV DNA (reference lab) undetectable on multiple occasions, HBsAg confirmatory assay negative, repeat ALT on alternate assay/reference lab normal, PEG precipitation for macro‑ALT negative, interference panel (RF, HAMA) negative, CK/myoglobin normal, liver biopsy histology normal, extensive infectious (HAV, HCV, HEV, EBV, CMV, HSV, mNGS) and autoimmune/metabolic (autoimmune serologies, ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, slit‑lamp) workups negative, abdominal ultrasound normal, and coagulation and bilirubin remained normal throughout. The patient’s reported yellow skin was not supported biochemically (normal total and direct bilirubin, negative urine bilirubin/urobilinogen), making true jaundice unlikely.\n\nDiagnostic conclusion: The most likely explanation is laboratory error or transient assay interference producing a spurious isolated ALT elevation and a false‑positive HBV serology result; the patient does not have biochemically evident hepatitis or active hepatitis B. The patient’s yellow skin is unlikely to be true jaundice and is more consistent with nonhepatic pigmentation (eg, carotenemia) or perception. \n\nWhy uncertainties were resolved: Multiple independent high‑sensitivity and alternate‑platform assays, tissue testing (biopsy), and broad infectious/metabolic testing failed to reproduce the initial abnormal results, making persistent or clinically significant hepatic injury and active HBV extremely unlikely.
