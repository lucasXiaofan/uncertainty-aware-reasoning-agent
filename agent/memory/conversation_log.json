Patient appears pale.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any bleeding or blood in your stool?\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed any bleeding. All my tests for bleeding have come back negative. I also have these crusts along the veins on my left arm.\n\n## Retrieved Experiences (id, observation):\nID: 1 | Observation: Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu. Physical exam shows crusts along veins on the left arm and pale appearance; vitals show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient expresses high cancer concern and requests invasive diagnostic laparoscopy.\nID: 4 | Observation: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm—local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\nID: 14 | Observation: Recurrent brief diarrheal episodes (a few days), migratory asymmetric joint pain focused on one arm, no objective inflammatory signs—normal WBC, CRP, ESR, normal stool studies, no joint swelling or warmth on exam or imaging, negative HLA-B27, and symptoms persisted across multiple ER visits without progressive structural findings.\nID: 16 | Observation: The agent relied on temporal association (diarrhea and joint pain starting together) without confirming typical reactive arthritis features: asymmetric lower-extremity oligoarthritis, enthesitis, conjunctivitis/urethritis, or antecedent known enteric infection; also patient denied classic extra-articular signs and had no response trial to NSAIDs.\nID: 2 | Observation: Lab pattern shows normocytic anemia with very high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggesting brisk marrow response, yet all hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin), direct antiglobulin test, peripheral smear including specialized hematopathology review, flow cytometry for PNH, erythropoietin, and bone marrow biopsy are normal. Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 10 | Observation: Pitting of the nails noted on exam and patient reports chronic dandruff (scalp scaling) — subtle cutaneous/nail findings that can be manifestations of psoriasis were present but not pursued.\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.",

Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 10 | Observation: Pitting of the nails noted on exam and patient reports chronic dandruff (scalp scaling) — subtle cutaneous/nail findings that can be manifestations of psoriasis were present but not pursued.\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.",

Use validated brief screens (PHQ-9, GAD-7) and ask about symptom impact on work/relationships. If positive or if symptoms are inconsistent with objective findings, refer early to mental health or psychosomatic medicine and consider multidisciplinary care (physiotherapy, pain clinic, CBT). Rationale: Recurrent multisystem symptoms with normal tests raise somatization which responds to structured psychological interventions; early recognition reduces unnecessary testing and harms.\"}"

The right arm pain and my diarrhea and nausea all started around a week ago—no trauma or anything, it's a constant dull ache with limited range of motion, no numbness, weakness, or radiation. No vomiting or bloody stools, just the nausea and loose stools.\nDoctor: Doctor: REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Examination.

Rationale: discordance between physiologic markers and lab findings suggests non-physiologic introduction or removal of blood or sample interference; securing specimen integrity can reveal factitious behavior and avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostics.\"}"

Palpation: No tenderness, masses, or abnormalities noted.\nDoctor: Doctor: How old are you, when was your last menstrual period, and are you sexually active without reliable contraception?\nPatient: I'm 34 years old. I'm not entirely sure about the date of my last menstrual period. My husband and I have been sexually active without contraception since I stopped my oral contraceptives six months ago—we've been trying to conceive.\nDoctor: Doctor: Have you had symptoms like nausea, breast tenderness, fatigue, or increased urination, and have you taken any home pregnancy tests—how many, when, and what were the results/brands?\nPatient: Yes, I've had increasing breast tenderness for about two months, some nausea, and more frequent urination lately. No real fatigue, though. I haven't taken any home pregnancy tests yet.\nDoctor: Doctor: Have you had any vaginal bleeding or cramping, any previous pregnancies or miscarriages, and any history of ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, or tubal surgery?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any vaginal bleeding or cramping. This would be my first pregnancy—no previous pregnancies, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, pelvic inflammatory disease, or tubal surgery.\nDoctor: Doctor: Are your menstrual cycles usually regular, and can you estimate the date of your last period or the last unprotected intercourse?

Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 10 | Observation: Pitting of the nails noted on exam and patient reports chronic dandruff (scalp scaling) — subtle cutaneous/nail findings that can be manifestations of psoriasis were present but not pursued.\nID: 5 | Observation: Extensive invasive testing (EGD, CT abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, planned hysteroscopy/colonoscopy) was pursued despite multiple red flags for nonorganic disease and normal directed tests. This led to recommendations for further invasive gynecologic and endoscopic procedures without addressing potential factitious etiologies.\nID: 12 | Observation: Negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP but elevated ESR/CRP — seronegative inflammatory arthritis is supported; absence of erosive change on X-ray and presence of subchondral sclerosis/joint space narrowing can coexist with psoriatic arthropathy, especially early disease.\nID: 11 | Observation: Presentation of asymmetric mono/oligoarticular knee involvement with prior brief episode in the contralateral knee, acute swelling with warmth and tenderness, and raised inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) — pattern is more typical of inflammatory arthritis rather than purely mechanical OA.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 13 | Observation: Back pain with limited spinal mobility reported, though not classical inflammatory pattern; coexistence of axial symptoms in an older patient with peripheral oligoarthritis should raise suspicion for seronegative spondyloarthropathy variants.\nID: 16 | Observation: The agent relied on temporal association (diarrhea and joint pain starting together) without confirming typical reactive arthritis features: asymmetric lower-extremity oligoarthritis, enthesitis, conjunctivitis/urethritis, or antecedent known enteric infection; also patient denied classic extra-articular signs and had no response trial to NSAIDs.\nID: 1 | Observation: Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu.

Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 3 | Observation: Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety. The clinical course (persistent symptoms despite leave from work) and request for procedures may represent secondary gain for attention or fulfillment of sick role.\nID: 1 | Observation: Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu. Physical exam shows crusts along veins on the left arm and pale appearance; vitals show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient expresses high cancer concern and requests invasive diagnostic laparoscopy.\nID: 4 | Observation: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm—local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.\nID: 5 | Observation: Extensive invasive testing (EGD, CT abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, planned hysteroscopy/colonoscopy) was pursued despite multiple red flags for nonorganic disease and normal directed tests. This led to recommendations for further invasive gynecologic and endoscopic procedures without addressing potential factitious etiologies.\nID: 10 | Observation: Pitting of the nails noted on exam and patient reports chronic dandruff (scalp scaling) — subtle cutaneous/nail findings that can be manifestations of psoriasis were present but not pursued.\nID: 13 | Observation: Back pain with limited spinal mobility reported, though not classical inflammatory pattern; coexistence of axial symptoms in an older patient with peripheral oligoarthritis should raise suspicion for seronegative spondyloarthropathy variants.\nID: 2 | Observation: Lab pattern shows normocytic anemia with very high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggesting brisk marrow response, yet all hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin), direct antiglobulin test, peripheral smear including specialized hematopathology review, flow cytometry for PNH, erythropoietin, and bone marrow biopsy are normal. Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 14 | Observation: Recurrent brief diarrheal episodes (a few days), migratory asymmetric joint pain focused on one arm, no objective inflammatory signs—normal WBC, CRP, ESR, normal stool studies, no joint swelling or warmth on exam or imaging, negative HLA-B27, and symptoms persisted across multiple ER visits without progressive structural findings.",

Dr. Agent: Please tell me your age, when the right arm pain and gastrointestinal symptoms began, and whether you've had similar episodes before.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Vital_Signs:** - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F) - Blood_Pressure: 115/75 mmHg - Heart_Rate: 82 bpm - Respiratory_Rate: 18 breaths/min **Abdominal_Examination:** - Inspection: No visible abnormalities. - Auscultation: Normal bowel sounds. - Percussion: Diffuse tenderness, but no peritoneal signs. - Palpation: Diffuse abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants without rebound or guarding.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: How old are you, exactly when did the right arm and gastrointestinal symptoms begin, can you describe the arm pain (sharp/dull, constant or intermittent, any numbness/weakness or radiation), and what GI symptoms are you having (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools)?\nPatient: I'm 21 years old. The right arm pain and my diarrhea and nausea all started around a week ago—no trauma or anything, it's a constant dull ache with limited range of motion, no numbness, weakness, or radiation. No vomiting or bloody stools, just the nausea and loose stools.\nDoctor: Doctor: REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Examination. Have you had similar episodes before, any prior evaluations or diagnoses, chronic illnesses or medications, and any recent fever, urinary symptoms, or new sexual partners?\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Musculoskeletal_Examination (Right_Arm):** - Inspection: No erythema or edema. - Palpation: Tenderness without specific localization. - Range_of_Motion: Limited due to pain.\nDoctor: Have you had similar episodes before or prior evaluations/diagnoses, any chronic illnesses or regular medications, and any recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts?\nPatient: I've had similar episodes multiple times in the past year, bringing me to the ER each time, but no clear diagnoses or treatments worked. No chronic illnesses, regular medications, recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: Have you ever had blood tests (CBC/CRP/ESR), stool studies, joint imaging/ultrasound, HLA-B27 testing, or joint aspiration for these episodes—if so, what were the results—and do you have any history of depression/anxiety, sleep problems, substance use, or loss of work/function because of these symptoms?\nPatient: They've done blood tests like CBC and CRP before, but everything was normal—no elevations or anything diagnostic. No stool studies, joint imaging was unremarkable, and no HLA-B27 or aspirations were done. No depression, anxiety, sleep issues, substance use, or major loss of work, though these episodes are disruptive.\nDoctor: Do your GI and arm symptoms always occur together and how long does each episode usually last; are there any identifiable triggers or recent stressors, and do you have sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or any impact on work or relationships from these episodes?\nPatient: Yeah, the GI symptoms like diarrhea and nausea always hit at the same time as the arm pain in these episodes, and each one usually lasts about a week or so before easing up a bit. No obvious triggers or recent stressors that I can think of, and while I don't have sleep issues or worry excessively about my health, these flare-ups have messed with my work and intimacy with my partner—like pain during sex.\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, or discharge during these episodes, and have you had urethral symptoms (dysuria or discharge) or a recent new sexual partner or known STI? REQUEST TEST: CBC_CRP_ESR and REQUEST TEST: Stool_Studies and REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Ultrasound.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Complete_Blood_Count (CBC):** - WBC: Normal - Hemoglobin: Normal - Platelets: Normal **Inflammatory_Markers (CRP & ESR):** - CRP: Normal - ESR: Normal **Stool_Studies:** - Fecal_Occult_Blood_Test: Negative **Right_Arm_Ultrasound:** NORMAL READINGS\n\n## Retrieved Experiences (id, observation):\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 4 | Observation: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm—local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\nID: 3 | Observation: Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety. The clinical course (persistent symptoms despite leave from work) and request for procedures may represent secondary gain for attention or fulfillment of sick role.\nID: 8 | Observation: No documented targeted psychiatric or psychosocial assessment was done to explore the patient's emotional state, fertility-related stressors, or potential somatoform manifestations despite classic psychosomatic symptoms and strong conviction of pregnancy.\nID: 16 | Observation: The agent relied on temporal association (diarrhea and joint pain starting together) without confirming typical reactive arthritis features: asymmetric lower-extremity oligoarthritis, enthesitis, conjunctivitis/urethritis, or antecedent known enteric infection; also patient denied classic extra-articular signs and had no response trial to NSAIDs.\nID: 6 | Observation: Patient reports strong, repeated positive home urine pregnancy tests and classic early pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea, urinary frequency, mild abdominal enlargement and weight gain), but objective testing is repeatedly negative: urine hCG negative, quantitative serum hCG nonpregnant on serial measurements, and transvaginal ultrasound shows no gestational sac.\nID: 12 | Observation: Negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP but elevated ESR/CRP — seronegative inflammatory arthritis is supported; absence of erosive change on X-ray and presence of subchondral sclerosis/joint space narrowing can coexist with psoriatic arthropathy, especially early disease.\nID: 14 | Observation: Recurrent brief diarrheal episodes (a few days), migratory asymmetric joint pain focused on one arm, no objective inflammatory signs—normal WBC, CRP, ESR, normal stool studies, no joint swelling or warmth on exam or imaging, negative HLA-B27, and symptoms persisted across multiple ER visits without progressive structural findings.\nID: 5 | Observation: Extensive invasive testing (EGD, CT abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, planned hysteroscopy/colonoscopy) was pursued despite multiple red flags for nonorganic disease and normal directed tests. This led to recommendations for further invasive gynecologic and endoscopic procedures without addressing potential factitious etiologies.\nID: 2 | Observation: Lab pattern shows normocytic anemia with very high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggesting brisk marrow response, yet all hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin), direct antiglobulin test, peripheral smear including specialized hematopathology review, flow cytometry for PNH, erythropoietin, and bone marrow biopsy are normal. Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 7 | Observation: Doctor concluded chemical pregnancy/early spontaneous abortion despite multiple high-quality negative objective tests (serial quantitative serum hCGs in the nonpregnant range and negative transvaginal ultrasound), and the patient's social history shows active and prolonged efforts to conceive (stopped OCPs 6 months ago, no prior pregnancies) and strong emotional response (happy to share news).\nID: 13 | Observation: Back pain with limited spinal mobility reported, though not classical inflammatory pattern; coexistence of axial symptoms in an older patient with peripheral oligoarthritis should raise suspicion for seronegative spondyloarthropathy variants.",

No, I've never injected substances, my own blood, or intentionally caused any bleeding.\nDoctor: Doctor: When was your low hemoglobin first discovered, and have you noticed it getting worse after work shifts or on days you have access to IV supplies? Doctor: Do you have any past psychiatric diagnoses, current stressors, or previous hospitalizations for similar problems?\nPatient: My low hemoglobin was first discovered during this visit with these blood tests—I hadn't had it checked before despite my fatigue starting two months ago. It hasn't seemed worse after shifts since I've been on sick leave for two weeks, but my fatigue persists regardless. I have no past psychiatric diagnoses or hospitalizations for this, but I've been under high stress from my nursing job.\nDoctor: Doctor: Can you tell me exactly how those crusts on your left arm appeared, whether you ever handle or keep needles/blood at home or outside work, and do you ever have thoughts of harming yourself?

No stool studies, joint imaging was unremarkable, and no HLA-B27 or aspirations were done. No depression, anxiety, sleep issues, substance use, or major loss of work, though these episodes are disruptive.\nDoctor: Do your GI and arm symptoms always occur together and how long does each episode usually last; are there any identifiable triggers or recent stressors, and do you have sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or any impact on work or relationships from these episodes?\nPatient: Yeah, the GI symptoms like diarrhea and nausea always hit at the same time as the arm pain in these episodes, and each one usually lasts about a week or so before easing up a bit. No obvious triggers or recent stressors that I can think of, and while I don't have sleep issues or worry excessively about my health, these flare-ups have messed with my work and intimacy with my partner—like pain during sex.\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, or discharge during these episodes, and have you had urethral symptoms (dysuria or discharge) or a recent new sexual partner or known STI?

Rationale: health-care workers have higher access/skill to induce bleeding or manipulate specimens; crusted veins and localized skin lesions are classic clues to self-injury or intravenous manipulation. Observed serial labs and direct visualization reduce risk of specimen tampering or covert self-harm and help differentiate true hematologic disease from factitious causes.\\n\\n[Experience #4]\\nPattern: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm\\u2014local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\\nSuggestion: Perform a focused dermatologic and venous site exam: inspect for patterned scabs, linear tracks, healed puncture wounds, unexplained adhesive residues, or tubing marks. Document photographs (with consent) and compare bilateral arms. Ask explicit questions about IV access, self-injection of substances (including own blood), or use of sharps at home or work. Secure sharp instruments if immediate risk is identified. Rationale: visible puncture marks and crusting are direct physical clues of self-inflicted intravenous manipulation; documenting and addressing access can prevent further harm and provide objective evidence guiding psychiatric referral and safe management.\"}"

Dr. Agent: Please tell me your age, when the right arm pain and gastrointestinal symptoms began, and whether you've had similar episodes before.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Vital_Signs:** - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F) - Blood_Pressure: 115/75 mmHg - Heart_Rate: 82 bpm - Respiratory_Rate: 18 breaths/min **Abdominal_Examination:** - Inspection: No visible abnormalities. - Auscultation: Normal bowel sounds. - Percussion: Diffuse tenderness, but no peritoneal signs. - Palpation: Diffuse abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants without rebound or guarding.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: How old are you, exactly when did the right arm and gastrointestinal symptoms begin, can you describe the arm pain (sharp/dull, constant or intermittent, any numbness/weakness or radiation), and what GI symptoms are you having (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools)?\nPatient: I'm 21 years old. The right arm pain and my diarrhea and nausea all started around a week ago—no trauma or anything, it's a constant dull ache with limited range of motion, no numbness, weakness, or radiation. No vomiting or bloody stools, just the nausea and loose stools.\nDoctor: Doctor: REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Examination. Have you had similar episodes before, any prior evaluations or diagnoses, chronic illnesses or medications, and any recent fever, urinary symptoms, or new sexual partners?\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Musculoskeletal_Examination (Right_Arm):** - Inspection: No erythema or edema. - Palpation: Tenderness without specific localization. - Range_of_Motion: Limited due to pain.\nDoctor: Have you had similar episodes before or prior evaluations/diagnoses, any chronic illnesses or regular medications, and any recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts?\nPatient: I've had similar episodes multiple times in the past year, bringing me to the ER each time, but no clear diagnoses or treatments worked. No chronic illnesses, regular medications, recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: Have you ever had blood tests (CBC/CRP/ESR), stool studies, joint imaging/ultrasound, HLA-B27 testing, or joint aspiration for these episodes—if so, what were the results—and do you have any history of depression/anxiety, sleep problems, substance use, or loss of work/function because of these symptoms?\nPatient: They've done blood tests like CBC and CRP before, but everything was normal—no elevations or anything diagnostic. No stool studies, joint imaging was unremarkable, and no HLA-B27 or aspirations were done. No depression, anxiety, sleep issues, substance use, or major loss of work, though these episodes are disruptive.\nDoctor: Do your GI and arm symptoms always occur together and how long does each episode usually last; are there any identifiable triggers or recent stressors, and do you have sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or any impact on work or relationships from these episodes?\nPatient: Yeah, the GI symptoms like diarrhea and nausea always hit at the same time as the arm pain in these episodes, and each one usually lasts about a week or so before easing up a bit. No obvious triggers or recent stressors that I can think of, and while I don't have sleep issues or worry excessively about my health, these flare-ups have messed with my work and intimacy with my partner—like pain during sex.\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, or discharge during these episodes, and have you had urethral symptoms (dysuria or discharge) or a recent new sexual partner or known STI? REQUEST TEST: CBC_CRP_ESR and REQUEST TEST: Stool_Studies and REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Ultrasound.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Complete_Blood_Count (CBC):** - WBC: Normal - Hemoglobin: Normal - Platelets: Normal **Inflammatory_Markers (CRP & ESR):** - CRP: Normal - ESR: Normal **Stool_Studies:** - Fecal_Occult_Blood_Test: Negative **Right_Arm_Ultrasound:** NORMAL READINGS\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, discharge, or any urethral symptoms (dysuria/discharge) or skin rashes/sores during these episodes, and have you had any known STIs or recent new sexual partners? Have you experienced low mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or noticed that symptoms sometimes help you avoid work/obligations or gain attention—would you be willing to complete a brief PHQ-9/GAD-7 screen?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any eye redness, pain, discharge, urethral symptoms like burning or discharge, or skin rashes/sores during these episodes, and no known STIs—I've only been with my one steady partner. No low mood, anxiety, sleep issues, or excessive health worries, and the symptoms don't help me avoid work or get attention—they just disrupt things. Sure, I'd be willing to do a PHQ-9 or GAD-7 screen.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: REQUEST TEST: PHQ9_GAD7; what treatments (NSAIDs, opioids, antibiotics, physical therapy, or others) have you tried in past episodes and did anything provide relief?\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **PHQ9_GAD7:** NORMAL READINGS\n\n## Retrieved Experiences (id, observation):\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 4 | Observation: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm—local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\nID: 3 | Observation: Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety. The clinical course (persistent symptoms despite leave from work) and request for procedures may represent secondary gain for attention or fulfillment of sick role.\nID: 8 | Observation: No documented targeted psychiatric or psychosocial assessment was done to explore the patient's emotional state, fertility-related stressors, or potential somatoform manifestations despite classic psychosomatic symptoms and strong conviction of pregnancy.\nID: 16 | Observation: The agent relied on temporal association (diarrhea and joint pain starting together) without confirming typical reactive arthritis features: asymmetric lower-extremity oligoarthritis, enthesitis, conjunctivitis/urethritis, or antecedent known enteric infection; also patient denied classic extra-articular signs and had no response trial to NSAIDs.\nID: 6 | Observation: Patient reports strong, repeated positive home urine pregnancy tests and classic early pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea, urinary frequency, mild abdominal enlargement and weight gain), but objective testing is repeatedly negative: urine hCG negative, quantitative serum hCG nonpregnant on serial measurements, and transvaginal ultrasound shows no gestational sac.\nID: 12 | Observation: Negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP but elevated ESR/CRP — seronegative inflammatory arthritis is supported; absence of erosive change on X-ray and presence of subchondral sclerosis/joint space narrowing can coexist with psoriatic arthropathy, especially early disease.\nID: 14 | Observation: Recurrent brief diarrheal episodes (a few days), migratory asymmetric joint pain focused on one arm, no objective inflammatory signs—normal WBC, CRP, ESR, normal stool studies, no joint swelling or warmth on exam or imaging, negative HLA-B27, and symptoms persisted across multiple ER visits without progressive structural findings.\nID: 5 | Observation: Extensive invasive testing (EGD, CT abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, planned hysteroscopy/colonoscopy) was pursued despite multiple red flags for nonorganic disease and normal directed tests. This led to recommendations for further invasive gynecologic and endoscopic procedures without addressing potential factitious etiologies.\nID: 2 | Observation: Lab pattern shows normocytic anemia with very high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggesting brisk marrow response, yet all hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin), direct antiglobulin test, peripheral smear including specialized hematopathology review, flow cytometry for PNH, erythropoietin, and bone marrow biopsy are normal. Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 7 | Observation: Doctor concluded chemical pregnancy/early spontaneous abortion despite multiple high-quality negative objective tests (serial quantitative serum hCGs in the nonpregnant range and negative transvaginal ultrasound), and the patient's social history shows active and prolonged efforts to conceive (stopped OCPs 6 months ago, no prior pregnancies) and strong emotional response (happy to share news).\nID: 13 | Observation: Back pain with limited spinal mobility reported, though not classical inflammatory pattern; coexistence of axial symptoms in an older patient with peripheral oligoarthritis should raise suspicion for seronegative spondyloarthropathy variants.\nID: 1 | Observation: Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu. Physical exam shows crusts along veins on the left arm and pale appearance; vitals show tachycardia and hypotension.

Dr. Agent: Please tell me your age, when the right arm pain and gastrointestinal symptoms began, and whether you've had similar episodes before.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Vital_Signs:** - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F) - Blood_Pressure: 115/75 mmHg - Heart_Rate: 82 bpm - Respiratory_Rate: 18 breaths/min **Abdominal_Examination:** - Inspection: No visible abnormalities. - Auscultation: Normal bowel sounds. - Percussion: Diffuse tenderness, but no peritoneal signs. - Palpation: Diffuse abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants without rebound or guarding.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: How old are you, exactly when did the right arm and gastrointestinal symptoms begin, can you describe the arm pain (sharp/dull, constant or intermittent, any numbness/weakness or radiation), and what GI symptoms are you having (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools)?\nPatient: I'm 21 years old. The right arm pain and my diarrhea and nausea all started around a week ago—no trauma or anything, it's a constant dull ache with limited range of motion, no numbness, weakness, or radiation. No vomiting or bloody stools, just the nausea and loose stools.\nDoctor: Doctor: REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Examination. Have you had similar episodes before, any prior evaluations or diagnoses, chronic illnesses or medications, and any recent fever, urinary symptoms, or new sexual partners?\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Musculoskeletal_Examination (Right_Arm):** - Inspection: No erythema or edema. - Palpation: Tenderness without specific localization. - Range_of_Motion: Limited due to pain.\nDoctor: Have you had similar episodes before or prior evaluations/diagnoses, any chronic illnesses or regular medications, and any recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts?\nPatient: I've had similar episodes multiple times in the past year, bringing me to the ER each time, but no clear diagnoses or treatments worked. No chronic illnesses, regular medications, recent antibiotics, travel, or sick contacts.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: Have you ever had blood tests (CBC/CRP/ESR), stool studies, joint imaging/ultrasound, HLA-B27 testing, or joint aspiration for these episodes—if so, what were the results—and do you have any history of depression/anxiety, sleep problems, substance use, or loss of work/function because of these symptoms?\nPatient: They've done blood tests like CBC and CRP before, but everything was normal—no elevations or anything diagnostic. No stool studies, joint imaging was unremarkable, and no HLA-B27 or aspirations were done. No depression, anxiety, sleep issues, substance use, or major loss of work, though these episodes are disruptive.\nDoctor: Do your GI and arm symptoms always occur together and how long does each episode usually last; are there any identifiable triggers or recent stressors, and do you have sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or any impact on work or relationships from these episodes?\nPatient: Yeah, the GI symptoms like diarrhea and nausea always hit at the same time as the arm pain in these episodes, and each one usually lasts about a week or so before easing up a bit. No obvious triggers or recent stressors that I can think of, and while I don't have sleep issues or worry excessively about my health, these flare-ups have messed with my work and intimacy with my partner—like pain during sex.\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, or discharge during these episodes, and have you had urethral symptoms (dysuria or discharge) or a recent new sexual partner or known STI? REQUEST TEST: CBC_CRP_ESR and REQUEST TEST: Stool_Studies and REQUEST TEST: Right_Arm_Ultrasound.\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **Complete_Blood_Count (CBC):** - WBC: Normal - Hemoglobin: Normal - Platelets: Normal **Inflammatory_Markers (CRP & ESR):** - CRP: Normal - ESR: Normal **Stool_Studies:** - Fecal_Occult_Blood_Test: Negative **Right_Arm_Ultrasound:** NORMAL READINGS\nDoctor: Do you ever get eye redness, pain, discharge, or any urethral symptoms (dysuria/discharge) or skin rashes/sores during these episodes, and have you had any known STIs or recent new sexual partners? Have you experienced low mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, excessive worry about your health, or noticed that symptoms sometimes help you avoid work/obligations or gain attention—would you be willing to complete a brief PHQ-9/GAD-7 screen?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any eye redness, pain, discharge, urethral symptoms like burning or discharge, or skin rashes/sores during these episodes, and no known STIs—I've only been with my one steady partner. No low mood, anxiety, sleep issues, or excessive health worries, and the symptoms don't help me avoid work or get attention—they just disrupt things. Sure, I'd be willing to do a PHQ-9 or GAD-7 screen.\nDoctor: Dr. Agent: REQUEST TEST: PHQ9_GAD7; what treatments (NSAIDs, opioids, antibiotics, physical therapy, or others) have you tried in past episodes and did anything provide relief?\nMeasurement: RESULTS: **PHQ9_GAD7:** NORMAL READINGS\nDoctor: What treatments (NSAIDs, opioids, antibiotics, physical therapy, or others) have you tried for these episodes, and did any of them provide meaningful relief?\nPatient: I've tried over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen a few times, but they only dull the pain slightly without fixing the arm stiffness, diarrhea, or nausea. The ER has given me anti-nausea meds and fluids before, but nothing provides meaningful relief—episodes just resolve on their own after about a week. No opioids, antibiotics, or physical therapy yet.\n\n## Retrieved Experiences (id, observation):\nID: 15 | Observation: Symptoms lack focal/localizing features and often coincide with healthcare-seeking behavior: diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs, arm tenderness nonlocalized, normal imaging/ultrasound/ labs across episodes, and the patient has multiple prior ER visits for similar complaints.\nID: 17 | Observation: Limited therapeutic probing was done—patient never tried NSAIDs and there was no trial of symptom-directed therapy or functional assessments to distinguish inflammatory vs noninflammatory pain. Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 9 | Observation: Management plan focused on reassurance and repeating serum hCG in one week without addressing the patient's belief in being pregnant, potential emotional impact of a nonpregnancy diagnosis, or arranging appropriate follow-up if negative tests persist.\nID: 4 | Observation: Physical findings include crusts along veins on left arm—local lesions consistent with repeated venipuncture, IV access, or self-inflicted injury. The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.\nID: 3 | Observation: Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety. The clinical course (persistent symptoms despite leave from work) and request for procedures may represent secondary gain for attention or fulfillment of sick role.\nID: 8 | Observation: No documented targeted psychiatric or psychosocial assessment was done to explore the patient's emotional state, fertility-related stressors, or potential somatoform manifestations despite classic psychosomatic symptoms and strong conviction of pregnancy.\nID: 16 | Observation: The agent relied on temporal association (diarrhea and joint pain starting together) without confirming typical reactive arthritis features: asymmetric lower-extremity oligoarthritis, enthesitis, conjunctivitis/urethritis, or antecedent known enteric infection; also patient denied classic extra-articular signs and had no response trial to NSAIDs.\nID: 6 | Observation: Patient reports strong, repeated positive home urine pregnancy tests and classic early pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea, urinary frequency, mild abdominal enlargement and weight gain), but objective testing is repeatedly negative: urine hCG negative, quantitative serum hCG nonpregnant on serial measurements, and transvaginal ultrasound shows no gestational sac.\nID: 12 | Observation: Negative rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP but elevated ESR/CRP — seronegative inflammatory arthritis is supported; absence of erosive change on X-ray and presence of subchondral sclerosis/joint space narrowing can coexist with psoriatic arthropathy, especially early disease.\nID: 14 | Observation: Recurrent brief diarrheal episodes (a few days), migratory asymmetric joint pain focused on one arm, no objective inflammatory signs—normal WBC, CRP, ESR, normal stool studies, no joint swelling or warmth on exam or imaging, negative HLA-B27, and symptoms persisted across multiple ER visits without progressive structural findings.\nID: 5 | Observation: Extensive invasive testing (EGD, CT abdomen/pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, planned hysteroscopy/colonoscopy) was pursued despite multiple red flags for nonorganic disease and normal directed tests.

Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.\nID: 7 | Observation: Doctor concluded chemical pregnancy/early spontaneous abortion despite multiple high-quality negative objective tests (serial quantitative serum hCGs in the nonpregnant range and negative transvaginal ultrasound), and the patient's social history shows active and prolonged efforts to conceive (stopped OCPs 6 months ago, no prior pregnancies) and strong emotional response (happy to share news).\nID: 13 | Observation: Back pain with limited spinal mobility reported, though not classical inflammatory pattern; coexistence of axial symptoms in an older patient with peripheral oligoarthritis should raise suspicion for seronegative spondyloarthropathy variants.\nID: 1 | Observation: Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu.

No, I've never injected substances, my own blood, or intentionally caused any bleeding.\nDoctor: Doctor: When was your low hemoglobin first discovered, and have you noticed it getting worse after work shifts or on days you have access to IV supplies? Doctor: Do you have any past psychiatric diagnoses, current stressors, or previous hospitalizations for similar problems?\nPatient: My low hemoglobin was first discovered during this visit with these blood tests—I hadn't had it checked before despite my fatigue starting two months ago. It hasn't seemed worse after shifts since I've been on sick leave for two weeks, but my fatigue persists regardless. I have no past psychiatric diagnoses or hospitalizations for this, but I've been under high stress from my nursing job.\nDoctor: Doctor: Can you tell me exactly how those crusts on your left arm appeared, whether you ever handle or keep needles/blood at home or outside work, and do you ever have thoughts of harming yourself?

My fatigue and abdominal pain are real, and I'm scared it might be something serious like cancer.\nDoctor: Doctor: Have you sought care at multiple hospitals or requested invasive procedures like laparoscopy before, and can you tell me what you hope to gain from more testing?\nPatient: No, this is my first time seeking care for these symptoms at any hospital, and I've never requested invasive procedures like laparoscopy before—it's just my worry about cancer making me desperate for answers. I hope more testing will finally explain my ongoing fatigue, abdominal pain, and why I'm so weak despite rest. Please, I just want to know what's wrong.\nDoctor: REQUEST TEST: Psychiatry_Consult.

Also, physical exam lacked tests for non-organic signs (e.g., Hoover sign, Waddell's signs) or functional pain reproduction.\nID: 3 | Observation: Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety.

REQUEST TEST: Ear_Examination\n[Turn 7] Measurement: RESULTS: Ear_Examination - NORMAL READINGS.\n[Turn 8] Doctor: How old are you, do you have any prior hearing loss or use hearing aids, and have you recently taken any ototoxic medications? REQUEST TEST: Dix_Hallpike. REQUEST TEST: Head_Impulse_Test. REQUEST TEST: Audiometry.\n[Turn 9] Measurement: RESULTS: Dix_Hallpike - Laying the patient flat rapidly with head turned to each side does not provoke symptoms. Head_Impulse_Test - NORMAL READINGS. Audiometry - Bilateral decreased hearing sensitivity, details not specified.\n[Turn 10] Doctor: How old are you, do you have vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation), do you smoke or use drugs, and was the hearing loss sudden and new or long-standing/one-sided versus bilateral?\n[Turn 11] Patient: I'm 27 years old with no vascular risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, or atrial fibrillation, and I don't smoke or use drugs. I hadn't noticed any hearing loss before today—it feels like it might be new and affects both ears.\n[Turn 12] Doctor: Doctor: Did your hearing loss start suddenly at the same time as the vertigo or did it develop afterward, and has it changed since this morning? REQUEST TEST: MRI_Brain_with_DWI\n[Turn 13] Measurement: RESULTS: MRI_Brain_with_DWI - No acute abnormalities noted, specifically no signs of stroke or significant lesions.\n[Turn 14] Doctor: Did your hearing loss start at the exact same time as the spinning vertigo this morning, and has your hearing changed (improved or worsened) since then? REQUEST TEST: Tympanometry. REQUEST TEST: ENG_VNG. REQUEST TEST: Full_Audiogram_with_Bone_Conduction_and_Speech.\n[Turn 15] Measurement: RESULTS: Tympanometry - NORMAL READINGS. ENG_VNG - NORMAL READINGS. Full_Audiogram_with_Bone_Conduction_and_Speech - NORMAL READINGS.\n[Turn 16] Doctor: Dr. Agent: Are your symptoms getting better, worse, or staying the same since this morning, and do you have any new visual changes, slurred speech, facial droop, or difficulty swallowing? REQUEST TEST: Nystagmus_Characterization.\n[Turn 17] Measurement: RESULTS: Nystagmus_Characterization - Nystagmus noted.\n[Turn 18] Doctor: Doctor: Is the nystagmus horizontal and unidirectional or is it vertical or direction-changing, and does visual fixation reduce it; also are you able to stand and walk without assistance or are you falling/need support?\n[Turn 19] Patient: I'm not sure about the details of the nystagmus—my eyes feel like they're jerking side to side steadily, and focusing on something seems to lessen it a bit. I can stand and walk without falling or needing support, but I feel off-balance.\n[Turn 20] Doctor: Doctor: Given the acute continuous spinning after a recent viral URI, horizontal unidirectional nystagmus suppressed by fixation, preserved hearing and a normal brain MRI, this presentation is most consistent with acute vestibular neuritis. DIAGNOSIS READY: Vestibular neuritis.\n\n### 3.

I get occasional nausea but no vomiting, and I had a cold a few days ago for which I've been eating more garlic—no hearing loss, ringing, significant headache, double vision, weakness, numbness, head injury, or new medications, though diphenhydramine helps a little.\n[Turn 4] Doctor: Doctor: Do you have any past medical history (migraines, stroke, diabetes, hypertension), take any regular medications, use alcohol or tobacco, or had similar episodes before?

They've stayed about the same size, no bleeding or itching, and they're completely painless. I tried treatments for syphilis and eczema there, but nothing worked.\n[Turn 4] Doctor: Doctor: Have you had unprotected sex or multiple sexual partners, any history of genital warts/HPV, and are you circumcised?\n[Turn 5] Patient: Yes, I've had multiple sexual partners over the years, including unprotected sex, especially back home—I've been married four times. No history of genital warts or HPV that I'm aware of, and no, I'm not circumcised.\n[Turn 6] Doctor: Doctor: Are the lesions single or multiple and about how large are they, are they raised/ulcerated or firm/indurated, and which appeared first — the genital lesion or the finger lesion?\n[Turn 7] Patient: There's one lesion on the shaft of my penis and one on my left middle finger—each about the size of a dime. They're raised with crusty, ulcerated surfaces, not really firm, and the penile one showed up first, with the finger one appearing a couple weeks later.\n[Turn 8] Doctor: Doctor: Have you had fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or swollen lymph nodes, and do you know your HIV status or what specific treatments were given for the syphilis/eczema back in Africa?\n[Turn 9] Patient: No, I haven't had any fevers, night sweats, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, or felt unwell at all. I don't know my HIV status—never been tested as far as I know. Back in Africa, they treated me with penicillin injections for syphilis and topical steroid creams for eczema, but nothing made the lesions go away.\n[Turn 10] Doctor: Doctor: Which country or region in Africa were you in and when did you return, and did you have any injury to your finger or contact with animals, soil, or thorny plants before the finger lesion appeared?\n[Turn 11] Patient: I was in rural areas of West Africa, mostly Nigeria, and I immigrated to the US about two months ago. No, I didn't injure my finger or have any contact with animals, soil, or thorny plants before the lesion appeared there.\n[Turn 12] Doctor: Do you smoke, drink, or have any chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, immune suppression) or prior skin cancers?

occasional nausea.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: acute persistent peripheral vertigo with nausea and imbalance consistent with constant spinning, Labyrinthitis: similar to vestibular neuritis but would include hearing loss/tinnitus (hearing status unknown), Cerebellar/brainstem stroke: central cause can present with sudden continuous vertigo and must be excluded despite absence of focal signs so far, BPPV: less likely because symptoms are not brief or positional\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), or other neurological symptoms such as headache, double vision, weakness, numbness, slurred speech, or difficulty swallowing?\n\n[Step 4]\nNew Info: Patient reports no hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear pain, and denies headache, double vision, limb weakness, numbness, slurred speech, or difficulty swallowing.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: continuous vertigo and nausea without hearing symptoms fits peripheral vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis: similar presentation but would usually include hearing loss/tinnitus which are absent making it less likely, Cerebellar/brainstem stroke: central cause can present with acute continuous vertigo without other focal signs early—must be excluded, BPPV: typically brief positional vertigo so less likely given continuous symptoms\nNext: REQUEST TEST: HINTS exam (Head Impulse test, observation of Nystagmus, Test of Skew)\n\n[Step 5]\nNew Info: HINTS exam: Head Impulse test normal, Nystagmus observed (type not specified), Test of Skew normal.\nDifferential: Cerebellar/brainstem stroke: normal head impulse raises concern for central cause despite lack of focal deficits, Vestibular neuritis: clinical picture of continuous vertigo and nausea fits but usually has abnormal head impulse making it less likely, Labyrinthitis: would include hearing loss/tinnitus which are absent so less likely\nNext: REQUEST TEST: MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging\n\n[Step 6]\nNew Info: MRI brain diffusion-weighted imaging shows no acute abnormalities; no evidence of acute ischemia or structural lesion.\nDifferential: Vestibular migraine: can cause acute continuous vertigo with normal MRI and normal head impulse, Vestibular neuritis: fits clinical course but typically has abnormal head impulse making it less likely, Cerebellar/brainstem stroke: MRI negative reduces likelihood but early/small posterior circulation stroke remains possible, Labyrinthitis: less likely given absence of hearing symptoms and MRI findings\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you have a history of migraine headaches or recent viral/upper respiratory infection (fever, sore throat, congestion) in the past 2 weeks?\n\n[Step 7]\nNew Info: Patient reports a cold a few days ago and increased garlic intake; denies history of migraine.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support a post-viral peripheral vestibulopathy, Vestibular migraine: can cause vertigo with normal MRI but patient lacks migraine history making it less likely, Cerebellar/brainstem stroke: HINTS and MRI negative lower probability but cannot be fully excluded early, Labyrinthitis: would include hearing loss/tinnitus which are absent so less likely\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Audiometry (hearing test)\n\n[Step 8]\nNew Info: Basic audiometry: bilateral decreased hearing sensitivity.\nDifferential: Labyrinthitis: recent URI, vertigo and new hearing loss suggest inner ear inflammation but hearing loss typically unilateral; Vestibular neuritis: post-viral continuous vertigo fits but usually normal hearing so less likely after audiometry; Bilateral conductive hearing loss/middle ear effusion: recent URI could cause bilateral conductive loss explaining decreased hearing and possibly imbalance but less commonly causes severe vertigo; Vestibular migraine: can present with vertigo and normal imaging but patient denies migraine history making it less likely\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Full diagnostic audiometry (pure-tone air and bone conduction), speech discrimination, and tympanometry\n\n[Step 9]\nNew Info: Full diagnostic audiometry (pure-tone air and bone conduction), speech discrimination, and tympanometry are normal.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: post-viral continuous vertigo and normal audiometry fit, but expected abnormal head impulse was not seen; Vestibular migraine: can cause acute vertigo with normal MRI/audiometry though patient denies migraine history; Cerebellar/brainstem stroke (posterior circulation): normal head impulse and persistent vertigo raise central concern despite negative MRI (early/small stroke possible); Labyrinthitis: less likely given absence of hearing loss and normal audiometry\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Video head impulse test (vHIT) and ENG/VNG including caloric testing\n\n[Step 10]\nNew Info: Video head impulse test (vHIT) and ENG/VNG including caloric testing returned normal readings.\nDifferential: Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: normal MRI reduces likelihood but normal head-impulse and persistent continuous vertigo keep central cause possible (early/small infarct or transient ischemia), Vestibular neuritis (acute peripheral vestibulopathy): recent URI and continuous vertigo support this diagnosis but normal head impulse, vHIT, and caloric testing argue against a unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo and normal MRI/audiology/vestibular testing though patient denies prior migraine history\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you have vascular risk factors (history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, smoking) or are you on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy? Also have you had any transient focal neurological symptoms (vision change, slurred speech, limb weakness/numbness) since the vertigo started?\n\n[Step 11]\nNew Info: Patient reports no vascular risk factors (no hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, or smoking), is not on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, and has had no transient focal neurological symptoms (no vision changes, slurred speech, weakness, or numbness) since vertigo onset.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: post-viral continuous vertigo and recent URI support this peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (head impulse, vHIT, calorics) have been normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo with normal MRI/audiometry/vestibular testing though patient lacks prior migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: normal MRI and lack of vascular risk factors lower likelihood but central cause remains a concern because of persistent vertigo with normal peripheral testing\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Comprehensive neurological exam including cranial nerve assessment, cerebellar testing (finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin), Romberg test, and gait assessment\n\n[Step 12]\nNew Info: Neuro exam: spontaneous nystagmus present; bedside bilateral decreased hearing reported; unstable tandem gait but baseline gait largely unremarkable; finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin normal; Romberg normal.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (head impulse, vHIT, calorics) were normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo and normal MRI/audiology though patient denies migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: persistent vertigo with nystagmus and gait instability raises central concern despite prior negative MRI, Labyrinthitis: would explain vertigo with hearing changes but prior diagnostic audiometry was normal making it less likely\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography of the posterior circulation (posterior fossa protocol)\n\n[Step 13]\nNew Info: Repeat MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography of the posterior circulation returned normal — no acute ischemia or vascular abnormality.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo support peripheral vestibulopathy, but normal head impulse and vestibular testing argue against unilateral peripheral hypofunction; Vestibular migraine: can present with acute vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing, patient denies prior migraine history but first presentation is possible; Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke/ischemia: central cause remains possible despite normal MRI/MRA (small/early infarct or transient ischemia) but likelihood reduced by imaging and lack of focal deficits.\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do you currently have a headache, sensitivity to light or sound (photophobia/phonophobia), visual aura, or a family history of migraine?\n\n[Step 14]\nNew Info: Patient denies current headache, photophobia, phonophobia, visual aura, and has no family history of migraine.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo fit a peripheral post-viral cause but objective vestibular tests (HIT, vHIT, calorics) were normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo and normal imaging/testing though patient lacks migraine history or typical migrainous features, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: central cause less likely given two negative MRIs/MRA and lack of focal deficits but persistent vertigo with normal peripheral testing keeps residual concern\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Since the dizziness started this morning, have your symptoms improved, stayed the same, or worsened? Also, have you ever had similar episodes of vertigo in the past?\n\n[Step 15]\nNew Info: Symptoms have stayed the same since onset this morning — constant low-grade spinning with occasional nausea; diphenhydramine helped slightly; no prior similar episodes.\nDifferential: Vestibular neuritis: recent URI and continuous vertigo fit a post-viral peripheral vestibulopathy but objective vestibular tests (HIT, vHIT, calorics) have been normal, Vestibular migraine: can present with continuous vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular testing despite no prior migraine history, Posterior circulation (cerebellar/brainstem) stroke: central cause remains possible given normal head-impulse and persistent vertigo, but two negative MRIs/MRA and lack of vascular risk factors reduce likelihood\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Have you taken any new medications or recreational drugs, consumed alcohol recently, experienced recent head trauma, or noticed ear fullness or changes in hearing since the symptoms began?\n\nLATEST RESPONSE:\nNo new prescription medications or recreational drugs. I haven't had alcohol recently, no head trauma, no ear fullness, and no changes in hearing that I've noticed. The only thing is the diphenhydramine I've taken since this started, which helps a little with sleep and the symptoms.\n\nTASK: Call diagnosis_step (or final_diagnosis if ready to diagnose)",

Otolith-specific vestibular dysfunction (utricle/saccule) or superior/inferior division lesion: could explain symptoms with normal semicircular canal tests and may be detected by VEMP testing\nNext: REQUEST TEST: Cervical and ocular VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potentials) testing\n\n[Step 19]\nNew Info: Cervical and ocular VEMP testing returned normal readings.\nDifferential: Vestibular migraine: persistent vertigo with normal MRI and vestibular tests fits though patient lacks migraine history, Atypical vestibular neuritis/post-viral vestibulopathy: recent URI and continuous vertigo support this but extensive vestibular testing (HIT, vHIT, calorics, rotatory chair, VEMP) were normal arguing against typical unilateral hypofunction, Posterior circulation ischemia/stroke/TIA: central cause remains possible given normal peripheral vestibular testing and persistent vertigo but two repeat MRIs/MRA negative and low vascular risk make it less likely, Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)/visual vertigo: may follow an acute event and present with dizziness worsened by visual motion—fits normal objective tests and persistent symptoms though usually more subacute/chronic\nNext: ASK PATIENT: Do your dizziness symptoms worsen with visual motion or busy environments (e.g., crowds, scrolling on a screen), or when standing/walking, and have you experienced increased anxiety or stress since symptom onset?\n\nLATEST RESPONSE:\nNo, the dizziness doesn't worsen with visual motion, busy environments, standing, or walking—it's just that steady low-grade spinning. I haven't had any increased anxiety or stress since it started either.This is the final question. Please provide a diagnosis.\n\n\nTASK: Call diagnosis_step (or final_diagnosis if ready to diagnose)",
