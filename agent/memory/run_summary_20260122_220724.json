Actions: verify blood sample chain-of-custody, repeat CBC with observed phlebotomy, review transfusion records, check for irregularities in lab timing, and request cross-lab repeat testing.

Orders: review and request prior lab reports/images, repeat quantitative β-hCG only if there is clinical suspicion of recent decline, and avoid presumptive labeling.

Also consider dermatology correlation for subtle psoriasis. Rationale: Psoriatic arthritis is often seronegative; negative RF/anti-CCP should not rule out inflammatory spondyloarthropathies. Early rheumatology involvement improves outcomes."

Ask about morning stiffness, heel pain, eye symptoms (uveitis), and family history of psoriasis/IBD.

Reasoning: Multiple negative objective tests across organ systems plus health-care–seeking pattern lower the probability of an evolving inflammatory disease and raise pretest probability for somatization; early recognition avoids unnecessary testing and allows timely symptom-focused management (psychotherapeutic approaches, CBT, SSRIs if indicated)."

If these are absent, avoid anchoring on reactive arthritis. Instead, broaden differential to functional disorders, medication/toxin exposure, or non-inflammatory causes. Reasoning: Reactive arthritis typically follows enteric infection by days-weeks and often shows objective inflammatory signs and sometimes HLA-B27 association; in their absence, the post-infectious explanation is less likely and treating as reactive arthritis may expose the patient to unnecessary antibiotics or immunomodulators."

Use a diagnostic threshold: if core inflammatory markers, imaging, and targeted tests are negative and clinical exam lacks objective evidence, refrain from further diagnostic testing and document the rationale. Initiate empiric symptomatic treatments (analgesia, trial of NSAIDs if no contraindication), arrange close follow-up with primary care, and set safety-netting instructions.
