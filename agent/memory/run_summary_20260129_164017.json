Key discrepancies: SPEP reported a pentameric (IgM-like) monoclonal spike but later quantitative IgM, immunofixation, viscosity and bone marrow were reported as normal—this discordance should have prompted repeat/targeted hematologic testing (repeat immunofixation, serum free light chains, flow cytometry, MYD88 testing) and review by hematopathology. Second, ocular findings consistent with paraproteinemic retinopathy/CRVO in context of monoclonal spike should raise suspicion for WM even without measured hyperviscosity; clinical correlation and consideration of early hematology/ophthalmology coordination (and plasmapheresis if hyperviscosity symptoms) were needed. Third, a normal bone marrow/hematology consult should prompt evaluation of sampling adequacy and specialized testing (flow cytometry, IHC, molecular testing) because WM diagnosis requires demonstration of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration; failure to ensure comprehensive marrow testing risks missed diagnosis. I'll save three learning experiences focused on: (1) handling SPEP/immunofixation discordance, (2) recognizing WM as cause of retinal hemorrhages despite normal viscosity, and (3) ensuring adequate bone marrow and specialized testing (MYD88) when WM suspected."
