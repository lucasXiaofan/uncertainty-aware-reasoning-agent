Key issues: (1) Biopsy interpretation—punch biopsy showed epithelial atypia but report did not confirm dermal invasion; diagnosing invasive SCC vs Bowen's disease requires pathologist confirmation and possibly deeper/excisional biopsy. (2) Premature systemic staging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis) and recommendation for urgent wide excision before confirming invasion—imaging and radical surgery usually reserved for confirmed invasive or high-risk lesions. (3) Interpreting the finger lesion as metastasis—metastasis between skin sites is unlikely; more likely synchronous primary or autoinoculation; management and counseling differ, and organ-sparing options exist. For each, craft situation, plausible differential at that point, a concrete action (ASK/PHYSICAL_EXAM/REQUEST_TEST), and concise rationale. Will save three experiences and then complete_analysis."
