    "observation": "Presence of multiple classic red flags for factitious disorder that were not integrated into differential diagnosis: patient is a young nurse with a strong, persistent request for invasive diagnostic laparoscopy, high health anxiety (“I might have cancer”), history of working in healthcare, and physical evidence of repeated venous access (numerous crusts along veins on left arm). Despite these, the agent pursued extensive invasive organic workup without considering self-inflicted causes.",
    "suggestion": "Actively screen for factitious/self-induced illness when multiple red flags present. Specific actions: ask about access to medical supplies and history of hospitalizations or unusual symptoms that only occur when observed; perform targeted skin examination and photo-document lesions; ask nonjudgmental questions about self-harm or symptom fabrication. Why: These steps help identify self-inflicted sources (e.g., exogenous blood loss, injection of substances) and avoid unnecessary invasive investigations and procedures.",

    "observation": "Laboratory pattern (severe normocytic anemia with extremely elevated reticulocyte count ~13%) inconsistent with chronic occult blood loss given normal iron studies, negative stool occult blood, normal EGD/CT/transvaginal ultrasound and absence of external bleeding. The agent treated the lab pattern as supportive of ongoing blood loss and pursued gynecologic/GI invasive evaluation without reconciling the discordant hemolysis workup (normal LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin, DAT) and normal peripheral smear and bone marrow.",
    "suggestion": "When severe anemia shows marked reticulocytosis but hemolysis markers and peripheral smear are normal, consider nonphysiologic causes of elevated reticulocyte counts (e.g., specimen manipulation, transfusion, exogenous RBC infusion, or laboratory error) and factitious blood loss. Actions: verify blood sample chain-of-custody, repeat CBC with observed phlebotomy, review transfusion records, check for irregularities in lab timing, and request cross-lab repeat testing. Why: Repeating tests under observation and confirming sample integrity can distinguish true physiologic reticulocytosis from spurious results caused by sample mixing or self-inflicted transfusion, steering management away from unnecessary invasive procedures.",

No attempt was made to observe symptom occurrence or to obtain witnessed hemoglobin/reticulocyte samples or urine tests to look for blood or substances.",
    "suggestion": "Implement controlled diagnostic strategies when factitious disorder is suspected: arrange observed phlebotomy for repeat CBC/reticulocyte counts, supervised admission with monitoring of symptoms, and urine/toxicology screens for hemostatic agents or oxidants. Consider photographing and documenting skin lesions, and use tamper-evident tubes or witnessed specimen drops. Why: Observed testing can reveal discrepancies between reported symptoms and objective data, demonstrate self-induced changes, and prevent sample tampering, supporting appropriate psychiatric referral and avoiding unnecessary procedures.",

Agent focused on organic workup exclusively and delayed consideration of mental health involvement.",
    "suggestion": "Early involvement of psychiatry and a multidisciplinary team when psychological or behavioral red flags are present. Specific actions: request psychiatric consultation for assessment of factitious or somatic symptom disorder, coordinate with nursing and social work for safe observation, and discuss findings with the patient empathetically to avoid confrontation. Why: Psychiatric involvement helps assess motivation for symptom fabrication, manage patient-provider boundary issues, and design a plan to ensure patient safety while avoiding unnecessary invasive interventions.",

    "suggestion": "When pregnancy symptoms and reliable home test positives persist but quantitative serum β-hCG and TVUS are negative, explicitly consider non-biologic pregnancy syndromes (pseudocyesis) and physiologic/psychologic mimics. Ask targeted psychosocial questions (desire for pregnancy, recent pregnancy loss or infertility stress, mood changes, history of psychiatric illness), perform focused endocrine workup (serum prolactin, TSH already normal—if not, obtain), and document timing of home-test positives with photos if available. Explain differential diagnoses to the patient and involve behavioral health or psychiatry for evaluation if psychological factors or strong pregnancy desire are present. Rationale: Symptoms can be driven by psychogenic mechanisms or by non-hCG endocrine changes; early recognition avoids unnecessary repeated invasive testing and supports appropriate mental health support.",

    "suggestion": "Require objective confirmatory criteria before diagnosing 'chemical pregnancy' — specifically, documented elevated or falling quantitative serum β-hCG consistent with early pregnancy, or reported bleeding with tissue/positive hCG prior. If home tests were positive but no serum hCG was ever elevated, treat as discordant results and broaden differential. Orders: review and request prior lab reports/images, repeat quantitative β-hCG only if there is clinical suspicion of recent decline, and avoid presumptive labeling. Rationale: Chemical pregnancy implies prior biochemical evidence; without it, alternative diagnoses (false-positive home tests, pseudocyesis) are more likely and management differs.",

    "suggestion": "Investigate circumstances of initial positive home tests: ask patient to show photos of the test lines, confirm brand/expiry (already done), timing relative to menses and sexual activity, and whether dilute vs concentrated urine was used. Ask about exposure to exogenous hCG (fertility treatments, supplements), recent trophoblastic disease history, or medications causing false positives. Consider sending a urine sample for laboratory immunoassay if discordant. Rationale: Differentiating false-positive home tests from true early pregnancy affects subsequent work-up and counseling.",

Offer empathetic counseling, provide early referral to fertility counseling or behavioral health as indicated, and discuss next steps in fertility evaluation (timing of intercourse, ovulation tracking, preconception counseling if conception not achieved after 12 months <35 years or 6 months >35). Rationale: Pseudocyesis has strong psychosocial drivers; addressing emotional needs is critical and can uncover contributors to symptoms and guide appropriate referrals.",

Ask about intermittent scaly plaques, timing relative to joint symptoms, prior dermatology diagnoses or treatments, and family history of psoriasis. Rationale: Nail pitting and scalp lesions are common in psoriasis and increase pre-test probability of psoriatic arthritis; identifying skin disease shifts differential from OA to an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy and guides further testing and referral.",

The doctor labeled this as mechanical OA despite signs of inflammatory arthritis (warmth, elevated ESR/CRP, asymmetric oligoarthritis).",
    "suggestion": "Differentiate inflammatory vs mechanical arthropathy by explicitly eliciting morning stiffness duration (>30 minutes suggests inflammatory), pattern of joint involvement (asymmetric oligoarthritis suggests psoriatic/inflammatory causes), presence of systemic symptoms, and signs of active inflammation (warmth, erythema, elevated ESR/CRP). If inflammatory features present, prioritize inflammatory arthritis workup (seronegative panels, imaging for synovitis/erosions, enthesitis assessment) rather than treating as OA. Rationale: OA typically causes pain worse with use and minimal systemic inflammation; presence of warmth, raised inflammatory markers, and migratory/swelling of multiple joints point toward inflammatory etiology.",

Radiographic OA changes can coexist with inflammatory arthritis, especially in older patients.",
    "suggestion": "Avoid anchoring on radiographic OA findings alone. When inflammatory signs are present, obtain targeted imaging for inflammatory disease: musculoskeletal ultrasound of the knee to detect synovitis/effusion/enthesitis, and plain radiographs of hands/feet to look for periostitis/juxta-articular new bone formation/erosions typical of psoriatic arthritis. Consider MRI if diagnostic uncertainty remains. Rationale: OA radiographic changes are common with aging and may be incidental; ultrasound/MRI can identify active synovitis or enthesitis supporting inflammatory arthritis and guide timely referral.",

Also consider dermatology correlation for subtle psoriasis. Rationale: Psoriatic arthritis is often seronegative; negative RF/anti-CCP should not rule out inflammatory spondyloarthropathies.

Ask about morning stiffness, heel pain, eye symptoms (uveitis), and family history of psoriasis/IBD. Rationale: Psoriatic arthritis often presents with enthesitis and dactylitis and may have axial involvement; identifying these increases diagnostic specificity and directs appropriate imaging and referral.",

    "suggestion": "Ask about timing and characteristics of symptoms in relation to stressors, menstrual cycle, and healthcare-seeking behavior; screen for anxiety, depression, somatic symptom disorder (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15); obtain collateral info about prior ED visits and treatments; consider diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder when objective findings are repeatedly normal and symptoms persist despite negative targeted testing. Reasoning: Multiple negative objective tests across organ systems plus health-care–seeking pattern lower the probability of an evolving inflammatory disease and raise pretest probability for somatization; early recognition avoids unnecessary testing and allows timely symptom-focused management (psychotherapeutic approaches, CBT, SSRIs if indicated).",

    "suggestion": "Require objective evidence before committing to reactive arthritis: look for asymmetric oligoarthritis with clear joint swelling/warmth, elevated inflammatory markers, or extra-articular features (conjunctivitis/uveitis, urethritis, enthesitis). If these are absent, avoid anchoring on reactive arthritis. Instead, broaden differential to functional disorders, medication/toxin exposure, or non-inflammatory causes. Reasoning: Reactive arthritis typically follows enteric infection by days-weeks and often shows objective inflammatory signs and sometimes HLA-B27 association; in their absence, the post-infectious explanation is less likely and treating as reactive arthritis may expose the patient to unnecessary antibiotics or immunomodulators.",

Use a diagnostic threshold: if core inflammatory markers, imaging, and targeted tests are negative and clinical exam lacks objective evidence, refrain from further diagnostic testing and document the rationale. Initiate empiric symptomatic treatments (analgesia, trial of NSAIDs if no contraindication), arrange close follow-up with primary care, and set safety-netting instructions.
