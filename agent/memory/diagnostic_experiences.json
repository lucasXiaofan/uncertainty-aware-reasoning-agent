Normal genetic testing doesn't rule out hemophilia if testing was incomplete or if there's a novel mutation.

Pneumatic otoscopy could reveal middle ear effusion, while Rinne/Weber tests would differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss. This direct physical exam would resolve the discrepancy and provide immediate evidence for or against labyrinthitis.",
