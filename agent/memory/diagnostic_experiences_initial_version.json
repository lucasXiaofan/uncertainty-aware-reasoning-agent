    "observation": "Patient is a 26-year-old nurse with persistent severe anaemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL) and marked reticulocytosis (13.3%) despite exhaustive negative workup for bleeding, hemolysis, marrow disease, GI and gynecologic sources, and normal iron/B12/epu. Physical exam shows crusts along veins on the left arm and pale appearance; vitals show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient expresses high cancer concern and requests invasive diagnostic laparoscopy.",
    "suggestion": "When a healthcare worker presents with unexplained severe anemia and high reticulocytosis but repeated negative objective tests for bleeding and hemolysis, actively consider factitious disorder. Ask direct, nonjudgmental questions about access to blood products, self-injection/insertion of substances, or intentional blood loss; inquire about patterns around work shifts or opportunities to access intravenous lines. Examine arms/venipuncture sites for fresh puncture marks, scabs, tracks, or discrepancies between reported and observed events. Obtain witnessed/observed phlebotomy and serial hemoglobin measurements in a supervised setting (e.g., inpatient with direct observation) to assess whether anemia fluctuates with unsupervised access. Rationale: health-care workers have higher access/skill to induce bleeding or manipulate specimens; crusted veins and localized skin lesions are classic clues to self-injury or intravenous manipulation. Observed serial labs and direct visualization reduce risk of specimen tampering or covert self-harm and help differentiate true hematologic disease from factitious causes.",

    "observation": "Lab pattern shows normocytic anemia with very high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggesting brisk marrow response, yet all hemolysis markers (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin), direct antiglobulin test, peripheral smear including specialized hematopathology review, flow cytometry for PNH, erythropoietin, and bone marrow biopsy are normal. Stool occult blood, EGD, abdominal CT, pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound are normal. Repeated identical CBC results despite multiple draws raise concern for nonphysiologic causes.",
    "suggestion": "Recognize that a high reticulocyte count with absent biochemical/hematologic evidence of hemolysis and no identified bleeding source should prompt consideration of specimen contamination, specimen manipulation (exogenous transfusion, reinfusion), or factitious blood loss. Actions: request chain-of-custody for specimens, perform witnessed sample collection and immediate repeat testing (including point-of-care Hb) to exclude lab tampering; compare venous versus capillary/point-of-care samples. If reinfusion or self-transfusion suspected, measure plasma free hemoglobin and consider observing the patient during blood draws and administering labeled autologous markers if needed. Rationale: discordance between physiologic markers and lab findings suggests non-physiologic introduction or removal of blood or sample interference; securing specimen integrity can reveal factitious behavior and avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostics.",

    "observation": "Patient repeatedly requests invasive gynecologic procedures (diagnostic laparoscopy) and expresses intense fear of cancer despite extensive negative imaging and testing; psychiatric symptoms include depressed mood and high health anxiety. The clinical course (persistent symptoms despite leave from work) and request for procedures may represent secondary gain for attention or fulfillment of sick role.",
    "suggestion": "When a patient persistently requests invasive diagnostics despite negative evaluations and has conspicuous healthcare-related anxiety, integrate early psychiatric assessment. Ask about motivations for testing, prior health-seeking patterns, history of multiple procedures or hospitalizations, symptom fabrication, and relationship with healthcare system. Use a nonconfrontational approach to explore stressors, secondary gains, or history of similar behaviors. Arrange a formal psychiatric consult (liaison psychiatry) and consider safety assessment (suicidality/self-harm). Rationale: factitious disorder often involves seeking medical attention and procedures; psychiatric involvement helps diagnose and manage factitious behavior, prevent harm, and coordinate care to reduce unnecessary procedures.",

The patient is a nurse, increasing access to equipment and skills for intravenous manipulation. Despite hypotension and tachycardia, there is lack of corroborating signs of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.",
    "suggestion": "Perform a focused dermatologic and venous site exam: inspect for patterned scabs, linear tracks, healed puncture wounds, unexplained adhesive residues, or tubing marks. Document photographs (with consent) and compare bilateral arms. Ask explicit questions about IV access, self-injection of substances (including own blood), or use of sharps at home or work. Secure sharp instruments if immediate risk is identified. Rationale: visible puncture marks and crusting are direct physical clues of self-inflicted intravenous manipulation; documenting and addressing access can prevent further harm and provide objective evidence guiding psychiatric referral and safe management.",

This led to recommendations for further invasive gynecologic and endoscopic procedures without addressing potential factitious etiologies.",
    "suggestion": "Adopt a tiered diagnostic approach: after first-line negative targeted tests, before escalating to invasive procedures, reassess differential and pretest probability. If clinical data are discordant, pause invasive plans and perform verification steps: witnessed serial labs, supervised inpatient observation, chain-of-custody for specimens, and psychiatric evaluation. Discuss uncertainty and rationale with patient, explaining that observation and supervision are safer initial steps than invasive surgery. Rationale: invasive procedures carry risks and may reinforce sick-role behavior in factitious disorder. A cautious escalation avoids harm and focuses on confirming physiological need for interventions.",

    "suggestion": "When patients have persistent pregnancy symptoms and strong conviction of pregnancy but all objective pregnancy tests (urine and serial quantitative serum hCG) and TVUS are negative, include pseudocyesis on the differential. ACTIONS: 1) Explicitly ask about timing/number/brands of home tests, prior positive results, and verify any prior outside lab hCG results. 2) Re-confirm serial serum quantitative hCG and review lab reports to exclude lab error or heterophile antibodies. 3) If testing reliably negative, perform focused psychosocial and psychiatric screening (ask about intense desire to conceive, recent pregnancy loss or infertility, mood symptoms, body image changes, and any secondary gains). 4) Arrange early mental health referral and schedule close follow-up to reassess symptoms and objective testing. REASONING: Pseudocyesis is a somatic manifestation of strong psychological desire or conviction of pregnancy producing real physical signs; distinguishing it from very early or chemical pregnancy requires careful correlation of reliable negative hCG and imaging with psychosocial context to avoid incorrect reassurance or missed psychiatric care.",

    "suggestion": "Avoid anchoring on 'chemical pregnancy' when serial objective testing consistently indicates nonpregnant status. ACTIONS: 1) Apply probabilistic reasoning: if quantitative hCGs are repeatedly below pregnancy threshold and are not rising, and TVUS shows no sac, the pretest probability for ongoing/ended pregnancy is low—expand differential to include pseudocyesis and lab error causes. 2) Ask targeted questions to rule out alternative explanations (recent hCG-containing medications, heterophile antibodies, prior home test details). 3) If uncertainty persists, seek confirmatory laboratory review (repeat serum hCG with a different assay or lab) before labeling as 'chemical pregnancy'. REASONING: Premature closure on an early pregnancy diagnosis may lead to inappropriate advice (e.g., expectant management for miscarriage) and miss psychiatric causes; confirmatory testing and broadened differential are necessary when objective data are repeatedly negative.",

    "suggestion": "In patients with discordant subjective pregnancy signs and negative objective tests, perform a structured psychosocial and psychiatric screen. ACTIONS: 1) Use brief validated screening tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7) and ask direct questions about mood, anxiety, recent losses, infertility history, and the personal meaning of pregnancy. 2) Explore behavioral signs: sleep disturbance, appetite changes, preoccupation with pregnancy, body changes self-monitoring. 3) If screening suggests significant distress or fixed belief in pregnancy, arrange prompt referral to mental health (psychologist/psychiatrist) and consider liaison psychiatry. REASONING: Pseudocyesis often arises from intense psychological stress or desire for pregnancy and benefits from early mental-health involvement; failing to assess psychosocial factors misses a key diagnostic pivot and opportunities for appropriate treatment.",

ACTIONS: 1) Communicate findings clearly and empathetically, explain the meaning of negative high-quality hCG and TVUS, and acknowledge the patient's feelings. 2) Offer a concrete follow-up plan: repeat quantitative hCG in 48–72 hours if initial uncertainty, or sooner review of prior outside positive tests; if serial hCGs remain negative, transition discussion to nonpregnancy explanations including pseudocyesis with offer of mental health support. 3) Consider involving gynecology and psychiatry early and offer resources/support groups for infertility or pregnancy loss. REASONING: A sensitive, stepwise plan prevents abrupt dismissal of the patient's experience, ensures confirmatory testing to rule out rare lab issues, and connects patients to mental-health care when symptoms persist despite objective nonpregnancy.",

Why: Nail pitting and scalp scaling are common and sometimes sole clues to psoriatic arthritis; identifying skin/nail psoriasis would change pre-test probability and prompt consideration of psoriatic arthritis rather than OA.",

    "suggestion": "Before diagnosing reactive arthritis, seek objective evidence of inflammatory arthritis and infection. Specifically: (1) Carefully document and attempt to elicit objective synovitis (joint swelling, warmth, reduced passive ROM) and repeat exam during symptomatic flare; (2) consider bedside joint aspiration if true effusion suspected to demonstrate inflammatory fluid; (3) refrain from inferring post-infectious reactive arthritis when inflammatory markers, stool studies, joint imaging/ultrasound, and HLA-B27 are repeatedly negative. Rationale: Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory seronegative spondyloarthropathy typically with objective synovitis, enthesitis, or extra-articular features; without objective evidence its probability is low and alternative (functional/somatization) causes become more likely.",

If positive or if symptoms are inconsistent with objective findings, refer early to mental health or psychosomatic medicine and consider multidisciplinary care (physiotherapy, pain clinic, CBT).
