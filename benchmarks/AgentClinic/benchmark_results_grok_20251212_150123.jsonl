On physical examination, there was fixed, tender lymphadenopathy in the posterior auricular, submandibular, and occipital chains. Laboratory testing was notable for peripheral eosinophilia.

Any recent infections, travel, or exposure to sick people?", "Patient: The bumps are definitely tender when I touch them, but I haven't really had a sore throat.
